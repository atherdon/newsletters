[Today](https://hackernoon.com/everyday-use-of-internet-of-things-iot-internet-of-things-iot-is-the-inter-connectivity-of-comp-f7n34xr), we rely on [IoT devices](https://hackernoon.com/iot-security-challenges-and-risk-mitigation-strategies-2fhf311m) more than ever with our security cameras, alarm systems, access control readers, entrance gates and more, all connected to this [massive network](https://hackernoon.com/5-effective-ways-to-handle-iot-security-challenges-11y3461).

Oral care devices and even wine bottles(?!) find itself among this group of [connected devices](https://hackernoon.com/the-emergence-of-iot-security-in-the-post-covid-19-world-sb1f3zmg). It is a sign of the [technological revolution](https://hackernoon.com/why-iot-security-is-only-as-good-as-the-weakest-link-ul3d3ut8) of our times to have an [IoT-powered device](https://hackernoon.com/how-does-triple-a-approach-to-iot-security-work-an-overview-em8e30z0) answer for every [need](https://hackernoon.com/iot-security-threats-in-retail-how-do-we-eliminate-them-iz7j366m), is it not?

If you’ve read our previous newsletter, however, you are well aware that all that is IoT-powered is not gold. While we have already taken a look at [obvious ethical concerns](https://hackernoon.com/resolving-iot-security-issues-with-blockchain-technology-3ffb36357094), let’s focus on something that we’ve missed - the [physical safety](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-secure-healthcare-facilities-against-iot-security-threats-ab28dd284cac) of [the Internet of Things devices](https://hackernoon.com/5-guidelines-to-ensure-iot-security-12d24ac34925).

The main difference between the IoT and the “traditional Internet” is that the former provides the ability to be [active in the material world](https://hackernoon.com/countering-iot-security-issues-an-enterprise-guide-8cfef499fc92). Along with sensors and communication, [many connected devices](https://hackernoon.com/the-dangerous-state-of-iot-security-e12d27552145) also include actuators, i.e., components used to manipulate the physical environment. 

*(Sounds a bit in the line with Rise of the Machines, don’t you think?)*

[In plain words](https://hackernoon.com/wake-up-the-time-to-care-about-iot-security-is-now-d4fd38bd28ae), it can be a door lock activated when the [user’s smartphone](https://hackernoon.com/the-growth-of-internet-of-things-effective-technology-opportunities-677f322m) is next to the door or a smart driverless car that steers in response to other vehicles.

Unlike the digital space where all threats boil down to cyberattacks, the [Internet of Things has actual presence and powers](https://hackernoon.com/iot-privacy-and-security-challenges-for-smart-home-environments-c91eb581af13), some of which might pose a [physical threat](https://hackernoon.com/14-iot-adoption-challenges-that-enterprises-need-to-overcome-jl213wgs) to users. Should the self-driving car glitch, its passengers, other road users, and pedestrians may all be in danger. [Additionally](https://hackernoon.com/a-look-at-the-security-risks-of-iot-devices-f0d6ffe1441d), [driverless vehicles can be hacked](https://hackernoon.com/smart-car-hacking-a-major-problem-for-iot-a66c14562419) just like, and along with, any other computing device. [Cybercriminals](https://hackernoon.com/smart-cities-cybersecurity-in-the-era-of-iot-6p103zsi) can take an autonomous vehicle hostage, and gain access to the car owner’s personal information.

The [plot thickens](https://hackernoon.com/securing-the-iot-edge-part-1-wp1p3t8l) when we dig deeper into what processes are required to ensure the physical safety of the users and device components.

A [tipping point](https://hackernoon.com/iot-cyber-threats-are-we-safe-from-attack-79324b032f31) here is administrative control and compliance with minimum safety standards. [For example](https://hackernoon.com/iot-hacks-and-vulnerabilities-347dbe2ef98c), cars should meet a set of minimum features for them to be [commercially sustainable](https://hackernoon.com/every-consumer-iot-device-should-be-free-d16219f66a45). [Bearing in mind](https://hackernoon.com/smart-home-technologies-that-will-raise-the-value-of-your-home-hh263wru) the physical risks posed to the driver, a bare minimum of compliance laws is not enough to ensure the road-worthiness of self-driving cars. 

On the other hand, our society is always lagging behind in [legislation](https://hackernoon.com/privacy-security-concerns-grow-for-wearables-677b70afa6e0), whether it’s the IoT or employment, which is why, in lieu of solid legislation, a company like [Particle](https://hackernoon.com/on-particle-iot-and-solving-hard-problems-cf3a210a36b1) is so valuable in this age.
