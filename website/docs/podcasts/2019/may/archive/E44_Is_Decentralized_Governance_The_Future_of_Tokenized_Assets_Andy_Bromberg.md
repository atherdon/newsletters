"It's a little bit like if in the early 90's we were trying to figure out what the best consumer product for the internet was going to be. You know we might have some ideas, but let's actually nail down some of this infrastructure first so we can actually build those consumer projects, and see them launch and have success there ...  A lot of people I hear are like, 'why hasn't there been consumer adoption yet?' And the simple answer is that the pipes just aren't there, the infrastructures not there. You know, it was ok in hindsight that we didn't have games being used by a hundred million people in 1992 on the internet, and we had to spend some time building things out first."

"I'm short term bearish on the tokenized assets, "security token", subset of the space. Long term I'm incredibly bullish. I think more and more assets will move to be represented digitally on a Blockchain, but in the short term I don't quite see it. I think it's going to be a little while before we get there. A lot of infrastructure needs to built out; investor demand needs to be built up."

"A lot of the value of crypto right now has been in speculation and financial instruments, and so decentralized finance makes a lot of sense at first, but then moving to some of these other things, like decentralized governance, that seems like a natural next step as more and more people become involved."
