“Donna Haraway is the author of "A Cyborg Manifesto". She wrote this idea about non-human allies that you’d have interspecies friendships. And that dogs, animals but also cell phones would be your not human allies. And again we don’t expect dog to act like a human, so why are we expecting AI to act like a human too?”
</p>
“ This is non-human. Whatever weird specie it is - that’s cool. It’s fundamentally it’s own thing. But let’s work with this and see what happens.” - Amber Case
