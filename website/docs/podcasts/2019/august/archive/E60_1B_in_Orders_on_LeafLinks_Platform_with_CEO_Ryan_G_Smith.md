“The use case, real quick, is if you are purchasing manager at a dispensary, typically you would text, email, phone call 30-50 brands every week or so to stock your shelves, now you can go on LeafLink, create a multi-brand cart, hit submit, and then those invoices get sent out to all those brands, and then they have some SaaS tools which help them then manage the life cycle of the order internally all the way through to delivery.”
<p>
“I’m confident about going through these processes but a lot of it is being comfortable, being uncomfortable knowing you don’t know. Those phrases that are too often used, but it’s true. If you think you’ve got it all figured out, nobody wants to deal with people like that. Everyone is just like an old baby, pretty much like an old child”
