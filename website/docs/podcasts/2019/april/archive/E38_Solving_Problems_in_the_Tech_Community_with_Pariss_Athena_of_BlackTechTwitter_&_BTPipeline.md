"It's scary. I even think about that for Web Development, because of things like Squarespace and Wix, where people don't even need to know how to code where they could just build their website from there. Are they going to automate that? Are people just going to be able to customize their websites exactly as need be without web developers? And it's like, okay in that case, you have to be the one to produce something like a Wix or a Squarespace ”

"I thought coding was going to be super difficult, but it's not, it's actually very artistic. Anyone can do it."

"This type of system makes people stuck. I'm trying to phrase that the way I want to say it, but you're kind of stuck. It's like, weighing your options, you're not going to get what you want, you're just choosing between what you can actually afford. It's holding everyone back, and this is why I worry for black people coming from lower income communities. Another thing is, they're not even aware that they can actually come into this industry that way. They don't know that, because they don't have exposure to it, because they don't have resources, and without resources you're just not aware. And that's the other thing that's frightening." - Pariss Athena
