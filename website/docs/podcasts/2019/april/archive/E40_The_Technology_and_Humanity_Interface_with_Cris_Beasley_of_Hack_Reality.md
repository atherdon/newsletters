“I am also spinning up a lab to bring together artists and technologists to create performance pieces that stretch consciousness and alter consciousness.”
</p>
<p>
“I thought a lot over the last few years of how we can be responsible technology-makers and make things that make us more even.”
</p>
<p>
“And I believe that we absolutely can transcend where we are in our current humanity. As long as we are building things that have this intent.”
</p>
<p>
“Then the question becomes how can you tell whether you are building something that is helping or hurting.” -
