<p>
In this episode Trent and Casey discuss some of the techniques Casey has been researching and presenting that are going to be included in his new book which he's still working on.
<p>
"It is so important to think about how we become our identity. We have to be very careful with how we are programmed. What is in our identity? What does that cause? We automatically find more of it, whatever it is. A lot of the time the authentic self is intuitively what I feel in my heart and soul, but maybe that authentic self was programmed by society, maybe that was no programmed by you. Maybe that authentic self means self author."
<p>
"It is interesting, is the ego, is the identity, are the things inside me, are they self authored? Or are they authored by others? We want to rationalize who we are, we want to feel good. We want to say, 'oh well I made all that stuff,' but did we?" -Casey Fenton

<h4><strong>Episode 11: An interview with creative entrepreneur, best selling author, and podcaster <a href="https://medium.com/u/5377a93ef640">David Kadavy</a></strong></h4>


<p>
In this episode Trent Lapinski and David Kadavy discuss elusive black swam moments, which are moments that describe an event that comes as a surprise and have a major effect.
<p>
“I had an event where my e-mail list went from 5,000 to 30,000 within a couple weeks. All these events, they kind of happened, and I did things to make them happen, but I couldn’t have predicted that they were going to happen. So I wondered to myself, how can you make black swans happen?”
<p>
“They suffer from interacting with an issue I call irrational rationality. Which is the treating of absence of evidence as evidence of absence.” 
<p>
“It always really turned me off, the whole A/B testing obsession that there was in Silicon Valley… Well yeah, if you can use machine learning to do that, that’s even more reasons for you to try and ignore those activities. Then look for the activities that are low investment, but uncertain in outcome. That uncertain outcome may be a very positive outcome.” — David Kadavy

In this episode Trent Lapinski and Miles Paschini discuss what it takes to build an effective crypto product.
<p>
“In bear markets the good people go build products, and in the bull markets people speculate.”
<p>
“Once you get to critical mass, theres a lot of friction that exists between the existing banking World, and the emerging crypto payments World.”
<p>
“We’re all in, we believe that blockchain is the future. We believe that investing in the alternative asset class of crypto should be a part of people’s future portfolios. We need to get to a point as an industry where we can point to things and say, ‘hey this is a productized example where the blockchain is better’ and it is being used at scale. But, remember you’re building a community.” — Miles Paschini

“For me I always ask myself is this an entrepreneur who that is special, talented, tenacious, and on a mission.”
<p>
“Is this someone who can go and tell a great story, inspire potential employees, investors, partners. Is this someone who people are going to gravitate towards? In a competitive hiring environment, are they going to be able to build a World class team?”
<p>
“I don’t need to see a huge amount of traction. I need to answer the question: Is there enough evidence or an unique insight that people want the product or service. I love founders that are incredibly focused on the customer. Is this someone who is just incredibly focused, and obsessed with the customer and solving their problem?” 
<p>
“Is this team on a journey that is important, bold, difficult, and inspiring? In someways does it make me uncomfortable because it is hard?”— Steve Schlafman

“These things that we have now, they are still in their earliest phase. We barely understand them. They are going to evolve into something so mind boggling different from what we have today.”
<p>
“We have to look to each structure, and abstract out the things that work and create new mitigation systems that solve the problems of the existing ones, and when we make the next iteration we stand on the shoulders of giants.” — Daniel Jeffries

<h4><strong>Episode 15 of the <a href="https://podcast.hackernoon.com/">Hacker Noon Podcast</a>: An interview with Venture Capitalist <a href="https://medium.com/u/fac67804e1ee">Julian Moncada</a>.</strong></h4>


<p>
In this episode Trent Lapinski and Julian Moncada discuss emerging technologies such as blockchain, augmented reality, virtual reality, to artificial intelligence. 
<p>
“I think that is really important that if you’re a hacker or developer that you balance the excitement you have around a new technology, around a new potential problem to solve, with the opportunity in the market and building a sustainable business.”
<p>
“If you build one without the other, if you have a great business plan, or you have some amazing idea but its not feasible, technically you’re not going to get very far.”
<p>
“I also think the inverse is true, you can build amazing tech, but if you haven’t thought through the market for it, or the value proposition it offers. Whether its a market we’re use to or whether it is a completely new market that doesn’t mimic anything today, if you had to make a call on that side of your business that can be very challenging as well.” —Julian Moncada

<p>
“The moment we start believing there is no other way, then it is just a race to the bottom. There will only be two companies in the World, and that’s if we’re lucky. There may only be one.”
<p>
“We have to be building a movement at the same time we’re building the technology. I think we need to be funding these kinds of solutions like this is the apocalypse event for the Internet.” —Tor Bair

“Compliance is definitely a top priority for us.”
<p>
“True USD is meant to be as regulatory compliant as possible. We recently published a stable coin code of ethics, where we said, ‘hey, here is some of the things we learned about creating a stable coin, and some of the past lessons we learned historically.’”
<p>
“We’re never actually going to prevent redemptions, because we think a stable coin is only good as its ability to redeem the underlying US dollars. We said we would never influence the price of a stable coin purposely by offering discounts. We will continue to be as regulatory compliant as possible and sustain the stable coin so it is not knocked down by miscompliance.”— Danny An

“What we look to do is engineer value rather than create speculative value. We’re personally not affected by crypto winter. As Wayne mentioned, we’re focused a lot on enterprise too and seeing where the value can be driven in enterprises.” — Gregory Rocco
<p>
“The combination of a global computer, smart contracts, tokens, all these things are going to help drive the transaction cost down of doing business, and you’re going to unlock new kinds of transactions that are going to form new markets that we couldn’t even imagine before.” — Wayne Chang

In this episode <a href="https://medium.com/@trentlapinski">Trent Lapinski</a>interviews Josh Stein from Harbor, a platform for tokenizing investments.
<p>
“When we tokenize these shares (using Blockchain) we’re just taking it out of the back office of the company. We’re recording the shares on this giant excel spreadsheet in the sky we call Ethereum, or Blockchain. But it’s got these great properties, which is that it’s public, so you know that if this smart contract represents shares, there’s no double counting of shares. And, you no longer have to go to the company to record the transfer of the shares. Buyer and seller can find each other digitally, they can transact digitally on the Blockchain, and in essence both of them are writing a new entry to the books of records in the company and they’re both signing it digitally.<em>” — Josh Stein</em>

"I jumped into this new ecosystem where I saw returns that I had never seen in my life. And that was what caught me in. That was the bait, and it was a good bait. But afterwards I started to dive into all those projects and I remember, I don't want to name it because my apprehension of this was a bit weird, but basically I saw this project and for a long time I thought it was a scam, and maybe it is, but still they showed that you can technically be able to open bank accounts for unbanked people without them having to read or be tech-savvy. And that was my 'aha!' moment." - Karim Sabba

<p>
“If you look at how much computational power something like AWS or Azure Microsoft, if you look at how much they have, it sounds impressive, and I’m not saying it isn’t, but when you compare it to the idle amount of computation that exists in all the phones, all the laptops, and all the desktops around the globe it pales in comparison. With this kind of software you can unlock this decentralized AWS, so to speak, that also takes into account the edge. And then of course, your laptop, when it’s idle, you can actually make money from it.”<em> — David </em>Sønstebø

<p>
<strong>A news breaking special episode of the Hacker Noon Podcast: An interview with criminal defense attorney Vinoo Varghese.</strong>
<p>
"Your question of is Julian Assange going to be extradited to the US? The answer is going to be yes." Vinoo Varghese, Criminal Defense Attorney
<p>
This is a special episode of the Hacker Noon Podcast. We just wrapped up an interview with criminal defense attorney, Vinoo Varghese, where we spent about 10-minutes discussing the arrest of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange. Due to the timeliness of this story, we decided to release this clip from the episode. The full episode will be released in several weeks, and discusses a range of other topics.

<p>
In this episode Trent Lapinski interviews <a href="https://twitter.com/ParissAthena">Pariss Athena</a>, Front end Dev/RN dev, creator of #BlackTechTwitter & founder of @BTPipeline platform, a community for people of color to mentor each other and find work. 
<p>
"It's scary. I even think about that for Web Development, because of things like Squarespace and Wix, where people don't even need to know how to code where they could just build their website from there. Are they going to automate that? Are people just going to be able to customize their websites exactly as need be without web developers? And it's like, okay in that case, you have to be the one to produce something like a Wix or a Squarespace ”
<p>
 
<p>
"I thought coding was going to be super difficult, but it's not, it's actually very artistic. Anyone can do it."
<p>
 
<p>
"This type of system makes people stuck. I'm trying to phrase that the way I want to say it, but you're kind of stuck. It's like, weighing your options, you're not going to get what you want, you're just choosing between what you can actually afford. It's holding everyone back, and this is why I worry for black people coming from lower income communities. Another thing is, they're not even aware that they can actually come into this industry that way. They don't know that, because they don't have exposure to it, because they don't have resources, and without resources you're just not aware. And that's the other thing that's frightening." - Pariss Athena

<h4>Episode 39 of the <a href="https://podcast.hackernoon.com/">Hacker Noon Podcast</a>: An interview with Nick Caldwell CPO at <a href="https://looker.com/">Looker</a> and former VP of engineering at Reddit.</h4>


<h4><strong>Listen to the interview on <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/hacker-noon-podcast">iTunes</a>, or <a href="https://play.google.com/music/m/Dfuna5a4pzsmjr76bxabkxdrhim?t=Product_Iteration_with_Hacker_Noon_Interim_CTO_Dane_Lyons-Hacker_Noon_Podcast">Google Podcast</a>, or watch on <a href="https://youtu.be/JGSnHpaCqZE">YouTube</a>.</strong></h4>


<p>
In this episode Trent Lapinski interviews  Nick Caldwell from Looker,  you get to learn about big data, machine learning and AI.
<p>
"Modern data stores are extremely powerful. You can put tons and tons of data into them. You can query them without losing speed. And in some cases, you can even do analytics in the database. We're just seeing this trend where the data layer is becoming more and more powerful, and Looker is riding that trend."
<p>
 
<p>
"My favorite learning, again, was just what's going on in the data engineering space. The BigQuery to me, at that time, was just mind blowing. You dump 4-5 petabytes of data in a big data store and query it all at once. It's stunning to me. I didn't know this thing was possible. And you can do that in an affordable fashion."
<p>
 
<p>
"My degree was focused in Machine Learning, and I think nowadays when people ask me about that sort of formal education, I tell them, 'You probably don't need it.' You can get really, really far in Machine Learning and just focus on the practical applications of it, without having to understand the underlying Mathematics of it. I think that's a really powerful thing, that abstraction."

“Something is not real, something about this whole reality thing is not right. And so simulated reality is a theory that we are living in the computer simulation.”

“The Earth as we know it is really simulated, some really advanced civilizations in the future could not computered in.”
<p>
“The virtual reality... we go there for whatever reason maybe to learn, to get education whatever. That is the theory of simulated reality. And it seems to answer all kinds of questions. Because you are thinking universe is data as opposed to matter in time and space.”<em>—<strong> </strong> Robert Adamson</em>

<em>"It's all about aligning the incentives of the three core users of the platform. You have miners who want more adoption, they want a bigger network doing more transactions a second. You have users who don't want to pay high fees. They want high security, they want decentralization, they want trustlessness, they want openness, and they also don't want to pay fees. And businesses who want to know that if they start using this platform and they start congesting the network, because think Cryptokitties - it launches and Ethereum gets clogged for a week, they want to know that the network can grow to support the throughput they need because they found their product-market fit."</em>
<p>
 
<p>
<em>"Overall, where I see the whole space going, is the sharing economy - the Enterprise sharing economy. This is one where you're redefining how consumers and businesses interact."</em>

In this episode Trent Lapinski interviews Andy Bromberg, CEO and founder of <a href="https://coinlist.co/">CoinList</a>. You get to discover the latest happenings in the blockchain industry, the future of ICO, and where the markets are in 2019.
<p>
"It's a little bit like if in the early 90's we were trying to figure out what the best consumer product for the internet was going to be. You know we might have some ideas, but let's actually nail down some of this infrastructure first so we can actually build those consumer projects, and see them launch and have success there ...  A lot of people I hear are like, 'why hasn't there been consumer adoption yet?' And the simple answer is that the pipes just aren't there, the infrastructures not there. You know, it was ok in hindsight that we didn't have games being used by a hundred million people in 1992 on the internet, and we had to spend some time building things out first."
<p>
"I'm short term bearish on the tokenized assets, "security token", subset of the space. Long term I'm incredibly bullish. I think more and more assets will move to be represented digitally on a Blockchain, but in the short term I don't quite see it. I think it's going to be a little while before we get there. A lot of infrastructure needs to built out; investor demand needs to be built up."
<p>
"A lot of the value of crypto right now has been in speculation and financial instruments, and so decentralized finance makes a lot of sense at first, but then moving to some of these other things, like decentralized governance, that seems like a natural next step as more and more people become involved."
<p>

“Donna Haraway is the author of "A Cyborg Manifesto". She wrote this idea about non-human allies that you’d have interspecies friendships. And that dogs, animals but also cell phones would be your not human allies. And again we don’t expect dog to act like a human, so why are we expecting AI to act like a human too?”

As well as the decisions that motivated the move from Medium to developing Hacker Noon’s own platform.
<p>
 
<p>
"The writing is on the wall that the next step for Hacker Noon is that it needs to be its own software.<em>”</em>
<p>
<em>“</em>People telling their own stories. We want to level that up by like 100x, and, the rich people deciding what stories should trend, try and slow that down.<em>” </em>
<p>
<em>“</em>Where we’re at in the landscape is we’re not trying to break news. We’re trying to get experts to amplify their voice. So when people are doing cool things in technology - research papers from Stanford for example - like that’s an interesting thing for us to republish and get very smart people who are building related things to read.<em>”</em>
<p>
<em>“</em>I think that young entrepreneurs are better off publishing something small each day than trying to spend two weeks getting into BBC or CNN or whoever their target is. How do I reduce the barriers for me to get something out each day? And each day I can share more of my story and my ideas, and that will attract more people that are interested in those ideas too.<em>”  —<strong> </strong>David Smooke</em>

<p>
In this episode <a href="http://www.haberdasherband.com/">Derek Bernard</a> interviews Lauren Maffeo of GetApp.  Lauren shares how she went from a Media Studies degree in Liberal Arts Media to Research Analyst of Technology at GetApp. 
<p>
“I majored in media studies in college pretty intent on going into journalism when I graduated. Unfortunately about halfway through college the recession hit and that was about the same time that ad spend was shifting from news organizations and news sites over to digital websites like Facebook and Google who now own an enormous total collective ad spend”
<p>
“The business model for a lot of journalism outlets collapsed and what was a competitive industry before became very difficult to enter after the fact.”
<p>
"In hindsight I think my media studies degree I thought at the time that those degrees were going to prepare me for a career as a reporter, but I actually think they were better preparation for what I do now as a research analyst because that kind of education primes you to look at a market, find gaps within that market, ask critical questions about the status quo and then give solutions for what to do differently. And I see a lot of parallels between my work as an analyst here and what I did academically, and so in hindsight that humanities education was great preparation for a career in tech.<em>”</em>

Cassie is Chief Decision Scientist at Google, where they've coined the term "Decision Intelligence Engineering", which is a service offered by Google designed to assist businesses in assessing their applied machine learning needs.
<p>
This article is from June 2018. Cassy explores the idea that when businesses attempt to utilize applied machine learning, they have a habit of attempting to reinvent the wheel

<h2>Episode 60 of the <a href="https://podcast.hackernoon.com/">Hacker Noon Podcast</a>: An interview with Ryan G. Smith of LeafLink</h2>


<h2><a href="https://leaflink.com/">LeafLink</a> has become a major player in the cannabis space, recently <a href="https://www.newcannabisventures.com/cannabis-wholesaler-marketplace-operator-leaflink-raises-35-million/">raising $35M</a> in their series B fund raise. Discover how LeafLink provides solutions in the cannabis space by streamlining the ordering, transparency, and sales rep processes with a robust online community and order management tools.</h2>

<p>
In this episode, Patrick Murray interviews Ryan G. Smith on how <a href="https://leaflink.com/">LeafLink</a> grew to $1B in orders on their platform, making up 16% of all B2B orders in the U.S. More at <a href="http://firstbillion.leaflink.com/">http://firstbillion.leaflink.com/</a>. Ryan also goes over how LeafLink became the first cannabis company named on Forbes' 30 Under 30 list and Fast Company's Top 10 Most Innovative Companies in Enterprise and more!
<p>
“The use case, real quick, is if you are purchasing manager at a dispensary, typically you would text, email, phone call 30-50 brands every week or so to stock your shelves, now you can go on LeafLink, create a multi-brand cart, hit submit, and then those invoices get sent out to all those brands, and then they have some SaaS tools which help them then manage the life cycle of the order internally all the way through to delivery.”
<p>
“I’m confident about going through these processes but a lot of it is being comfortable, being uncomfortable knowing you don’t know. Those phrases that are too often used, but it’s true. If you think you’ve got it all figured out, nobody wants to deal with people like that. Everyone is just like an old baby, pretty much like an old child”

<h2>Episode 61 of the <a href="https://podcast.hackernoon.com/">Hacker Noon Podcast</a>: An interview with Author/Entrepreneur Riz Virk</h2>

<p>
In this episode <a href="http://www.haberdasherband.com/">Derek Bernard</a> interviews Hacker Noon contributing author, Riz Virk to discuss his recently published book, The Simulation Hypothesis. 
<p>
In a world where the nature of our being in this place we call reality is so often taken for granted amidst the need to sustain the status quo, Riz explores the very real possibility (and in some schools of thought, a very real PROBability) that what we experience as “real” is in fact a simulation akin to a video game with it’s quests, achievements, and leveling up through our experiences.
<p>
“What is Science and what is Religion? Both are attempts to try to find the truth about our physical reality and what is inside or outside of that reality and what the rules are. In the Simulation Hypothesis what science is actually discovering is what we in the video game world would call a physics engine.”
<p>
“The Simulation Hypothesis is a model that we live in an information-based reality that’s being rendered for each of us may end up coming closer to explaining these things than a lot of other models that are out there.”

<p>
They cover what went right, what went wrong, as well as some of the noonies biggest winners.
<p>
 
<p>
“When we were conceptualizing this idea for the awards voting/polling situation, we didn’t really find any obvious, simple voting or polling apps. And as far as we could tell, none of the solutions allowed us to set up a situation where there was a very light touch voting opportunity for users, so we opted to build one ourselves”
<p>
<em> —<strong> </strong>Storm Farrell</em>
<p>
“The tech industries greenest awards! The noonies were built to recognize perfectly the best and worst people and products of the internet, and indeed they were.”
<p>
“Thank you to the community for taking part. There were a lot of who were really enthusiastic, and I’m grateful.”
<p>
<em> —<strong> </strong>Natasha Nel</em>
<p>
“There’s areas where we can go further with custom voting and how what we choose to build with the future of the product is it’s kind of interesting to think about how content is shared, and then when it’s curated well, how is it shared more.”

In this episode <a href="http://www.haberdasherband.com/">Derek Bernard</a> interviews Hacker Noon contributing author, <a href="https://mozgovoy.me/">Anton Mozgovoy</a>, former VP of Technology at Humaniq. 
<p>
They discuss his prior project in which the blockchain was utilized and a coin created to bring financial power to the unbanked in Africa; at its peak, they were 500,000 members strong. They also get a bit into the challenges facing the growing generational divide being accelerated by the pace of advancing technology, as well as the global forces at play in the technology space.
<p>
“There are actually close to 2 billion people on the planet that don’t have access to the banking system. They’re still using cash; they’re still trading with each other. It’s just that they’re not trading on a global scale. It means that they can send money [over] a distance.”
<p>
“That’s just one simple use case if you’d applied to many different models out there. One of the biggest ones that blockchain people really refer to which is Metcalf’s Law that tells you that the power of the system is quadratically correlated to the number of people that are involved in it and then they like to apply it to: what would happen if we could get those 2 billion that are right now excluded and include them into this global eco-system.”

In this episode HackerHodl (Utsav) interviews Cardano co-Founder and IOHK CEO, <a href="https://iohk.io/en/team/charles-hoskinson">Charles Hoskinson</a>.
<p>
They discuss Cardano as a blockchain and an enabler of functional Smart Contracts to drive scalable, secure, and fast transactions over the chain. Cardano just launched their Shelley update that is also an incentivized testnet.
<p>
“The model for smart contracts is broken or people were sold this idea that your entire application lives on the Blockchain. The reality is it doesn't. It's a service oriented architecture. So if you're gonna have your own servers, you have clients, you have a server-client model, but there's certain parts of your business logic in your application that are too trusted. So you take them out.”
<p>
“People forget the 19th century. America had hundreds of private money. All of them failed. So then after the first generation, people said, wow, this stuff is here to stay. We can decentralize trust, create a common source of truth amongst people. We can push money around. The problem with Bitcoin is that it is blind, deaf and dumb. It doesn't understand the world around it. You can't do smart transactions.”

<p>
In this episode <a href="https://hackernoon.com/@linh">Linh Dao Smooke</a> and <a href="https://hackernoon.com/@Hackerhodl">Utsav Jaiswal</a> interview <a href="https://twitter.com/Inside_NEM?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Alex Tinsman</a>, President at NEM.io Foundation and NEM’s CTO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaiyzen/">Nate D’Amico</a>.  
<p>
They discuss cryptocurrency adoption, difference between NEM, a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency and blockchain platform, and Nem.IO Foundation, gender role in crypto tech spheres, blockchain decentralization, Nem’s operation mindset and the future of NEM. 
<p>
Interview was recorded on January 18th, 2020. 
<p>
<em>“What's pretty interesting about the trajectory with the path for the NEM is that it was so forward thinking with the security features that it has always overcome and remained when all these other coins on platforms kind of went away. I think it has a bright future with technology. Platforms like NEM stick around because they are forward thinking with their features and their abilities.”</em> 
<p>
<em>“I want to be a part of change and the only way to do so is to educate yourself. And the only way to educate yourself is to get dirty. To get dirty with the code, get dirty with the channels, understand. Get into the thick of it. And then it gets really exciting [blockchain and cryptocurrency) because it opens up the opportunity for anyone. Anyone, no matter what your skills set is, everyone has the same level of playing field.  So I don't really think of it as a female thing, I think of it as an empowering tool that anyone and everyone can be a part of. So to me it's not gender, it's a movement.” -</em>
<p>
<em><a href="https://twitter.com/Inside_NEM?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Alex Tinsman</a></em>
<p>
<em>“If someone on even local, city council level wanted to do a similar voting style that we are using for the NEM ecosystem, they could launch a private or public chain and it doesn't really matter as functionally of the network would be doing the same thing. They could launch a private chain or public chain and still make it auditable, so anyone could have a verifiable data that they would check and download. And then they could configure that network by just tuning a couple labs when they launch it to decide how the consensus works. So if you’re launching a six server node of private network for local city council loading and you’re gonna use it once and then archive it for historical verification purposes, and then every year stand up a new network - you could configure it in a very simplified way that gives you total control on how to protect the network.”</em>

<p>
They talk about <a href="https://hackernoon.com/tagged/holochain">Holochain</a>’s mission and values, how it differs from Blockchains, and how to manage distributed teams. 
<p>
 
<p>
<em>“What we've been interested in is really how do we collectively shape currents, flows for a better world, for greater collective intelligence, for coordinating and collaborating better.”</em>
<p>
<em> - <a href="https://twitter.com/artbrock?lang=en">Arthur Brock</a></em>
<p>
 
<p>
<em>“Holochain is what we've come to after a very long time and a lot of intense efforts in understanding those (biological) patterns of how to create tools for distributed collective intelligence... And Holochain is our answer to being able to do that.”</em>
<p>
- <a href="https://twitter.com/zippy314?lang=en">Eric Harris-Braun</a>
<p>
 
<p>
<em>“It creates currencies that are not speculated. It creates currencies that are based on actual production. People, for a long time, have been wondering why we have all these currencies when the government can issue as much of it as they want, whenever they want. </em>
<p>
<em>It's funny, in the blockchain world, they call their currencies non-fiat and government currencies - fiat, but blockchain currencies are also actually fiat. </em>
<p>
<strong><em>They are declared out of nowhere. </em></strong>
<p>
<em>Whereas, if you do this other pattern of creating mutual credit currencies based on productive capacity, then you are actually creating something that represents actual value in the world and <strong>our economics can become based on value rather than speculation</strong>.”</em>

<p>
<strong>Join Hacker Noon’s Managing Editor, Natasha Nel, for a quick briefing on this year’s biggest, greenest and most independent tech industry awards: Hacker Noon’s prestigious #Noonies.<em> </em></strong>
<p>
<em>.</em>
<p>
<em>The 2020 #Noonies are made possible by Amplify Brokerage, the world’s first global zero trading fee cryptocurrency trading platform. GET STARTED: <a href="https://bit.ly/2O9xrzJ">https://bit.ly/2O9xrzJ</a> </em>
<p>
<em>.</em>
<p>
The original Noonies was conceptualized in early 2019, mostly as a ploy to distract our community from how many things were wrong with the site when we first moved off Medium in July of that same year. It turned into something bigger than we at Hacker Noon could’ve ever imagined.
<p>
.
<p>
This year, we’ve 10x’d the thing (sorry - touchy phrase in tech these days, I know) and the New Noonies includes two new award categories, and over 100 new award titles. In this quick listen, Natasha runs you through this year’s Noonies selection process; a few of her favourite awards, and how nominations and voting will work this year. Enjoy!

<p>
In this episode, Amy Tom talks to Matt Groves, the Senior Product Marketing Manager at Couchbase, and Brant Burnett, the Systems Architect at CenterEdge Software about the results from the 2020 Tech Lead Developer survey that was conducted by Couchbase. The survey revealed that 86% of respondents experienced challenges within their development teams. Amy, Matt, and Brant broke down the challenges, which included setting clear, measurable goals and having access to the right technology.
<p>
 
<p>
<strong><em>In this episode, Amy talks to Matt and Brant about:</em></strong>
<ul>

<li>Setting clear and measurable goals was indicated as one of the biggest challenges developer teams faced in 2020 (06:48)

<li>Investing in the right tools can save you time and money. Remember that the tools aren't generally your biggest expense; the people are. Focusing on making them as productive as possible is really the best way to save money (09:10)

<li>Addressing organizational technical debt is another common challenge that developer teams face (15:22)

<li>Hiring increased in development teams across 2020. Last year opened the doors to remote hiring, which allows developer teams to hire the best of the best regardless of timezone (26:19)
