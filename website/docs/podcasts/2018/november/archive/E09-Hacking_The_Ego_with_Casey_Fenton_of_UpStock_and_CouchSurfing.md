"It is so important to think about how we become our identity. We have to be very careful with how we are programmed. What is in our identity? What does that cause? We automatically find more of it, whatever it is. A lot of the time the authentic self is intuitively what I feel in my heart and soul, but maybe that authentic self was programmed by society, maybe that was no programmed by you. Maybe that authentic self means self author."
</p>
"It is interesting, is the ego, is the identity, are the things inside me, are they self authored? Or are they authored by others? We want to rationalize who we are, we want to feel good. We want to say, 'oh well I made all that stuff,' but did we?" -Casey Fenton
