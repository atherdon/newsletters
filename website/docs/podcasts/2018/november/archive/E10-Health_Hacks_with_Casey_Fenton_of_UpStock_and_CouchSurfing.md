In this episode Trent and Casey discuss health hacks, how to live longer, and how to improve your overall health with simple tips and tricks.
<p>
"If you can get someone in your life who loves you, to help you hack yourselfâ€¦ to get you to think 'I care about my health, I care about my health, I want to live a healthy way for a long time.' Get someone to help you get that kernel, that little nugget that is health hacking, and that will grow." 
</p>
"You will start to see all little things in your environment, all over the place, that corroborate and bolster of this identity that 'I care about my health, and I love myself,' and all that good stuff."- Casey Fenton
