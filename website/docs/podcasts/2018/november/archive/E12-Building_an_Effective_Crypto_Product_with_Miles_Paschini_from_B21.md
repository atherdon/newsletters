<h4>November 20, 2018</h4>

<h4><strong>Episode 12: An interview with entrepreneur <a href="https://medium.com/u/e8efd19e355">Miles Paschini</a> from <a href="https://www.b21.io/en">B21</a>.</strong></h4>

<p>
In this episode Trent Lapinski and Miles Paschini discuss what it takes to build an effective crypto product.
</p>
“In bear markets the good people go build products, and in the bull markets people speculate.”
<p>
“Once you get to critical mass, theres a lot of friction that exists between the existing banking World, and the emerging crypto payments World.”
</p>
“We’re all in, we believe that blockchain is the future. We believe that investing in the alternative asset class of crypto should be a part of people’s future portfolios. We need to get to a point as an industry where we can point to things and say, ‘hey this is a productized example where the blockchain is better’ and it is being used at scale. But, remember you’re building a community.” — Miles Paschini
