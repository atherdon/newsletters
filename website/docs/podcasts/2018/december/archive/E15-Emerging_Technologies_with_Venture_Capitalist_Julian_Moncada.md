<h4>December 12, 2018</h4>

<h4><strong>Episode 15 of the <a href="https://podcast.hackernoon.com/">Hacker Noon Podcast</a>: An interview with Venture Capitalist <a href="https://medium.com/u/fac67804e1ee">Julian Moncada</a>.</strong></h4>

<p>
In this episode Trent Lapinski and Julian Moncada discuss emerging technologies such as blockchain, augmented reality, virtual reality, to artificial intelligence. 
</p>
“I think that is really important that if you’re a hacker or developer that you balance the excitement you have around a new technology, around a new potential problem to solve, with the opportunity in the market and building a sustainable business.”
<p>
“If you build one without the other, if you have a great business plan, or you have some amazing idea but its not feasible, technically you’re not going to get very far.”
</p>
“I also think the inverse is true, you can build amazing tech, but if you haven’t thought through the market for it, or the value proposition it offers. Whether its a market we’re use to or whether it is a completely new market that doesn’t mimic anything today, if you had to make a call on that side of your business that can be very challenging as well.” —Julian Moncada
