<h4>December 19, 2018</h4>

<h4><strong>Episode 16 of the <a href="https://podcast.hackernoon.com/">Hacker Noon Podcast</a>: An interview with <a href="https://medium.com/u/4f1ea3b8f8d6">Tor Bair</a> from <a href="https://enigma.co/">Enigma</a>.</strong></h4>

<p>
In this episode Trent Lapinski and Tor Bair discuss privacy, blockchain, the problems with the centralized tech industry, security, and data science. 
</p>
“I don’t want to get too much into why truth is broken right now in the tech space, that’s a whole other can of worms, but I think we can all appreciate that it is getting harder and harder to know what is trustable.”
<p>
“The moment we start believing there is no other way, then it is just a race to the bottom. There will only be two companies in the World, and that’s if we’re lucky. There may only be one.”
</p>
“We have to be building a movement at the same time we’re building the technology. I think we need to be funding these kinds of solutions like this is the apocalypse event for the Internet.” —Tor Bair
