<h4>December 3, 2018</h4>

<h4><strong>Episode 13: An interview with venture capitalist <a href="https://medium.com/u/e687a7f386b9">Steve Schlafman</a> from <a href="https://www.primary.vc/">Primary Ventures</a>.</strong></h4>

<p>
In this episode Trent Lapinski and <a href="https://medium.com/u/e687a7f386b9">Steve Schlafman</a> discuss venture capital, leadership, executive coaching, and even mediation.
</p>
“For me I always ask myself is this an entrepreneur who that is special, talented, tenacious, and on a mission.”
<p>
“Is this someone who can go and tell a great story, inspire potential employees, investors, partners. Is this someone who people are going to gravitate towards? In a competitive hiring environment, are they going to be able to build a World class team?”
</p>
“I don’t need to see a huge amount of traction. I need to answer the question: Is there enough evidence or an unique insight that people want the product or service. I love founders that are incredibly focused on the customer. Is this someone who is just incredibly focused, and obsessed with the customer and solving their problem?” 
<p>
“Is this team on a journey that is important, bold, difficult, and inspiring? In someways does it make me uncomfortable because it is hard?”— Steve Schlafman
