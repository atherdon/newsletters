# What is code quality?

Code quality refers to the attributes and characteristics of your code. These may differ according to your organization's specific business focus and the particular needs of your team. While there's no definitive checklist, there are broadly several things that separate good quality code from poor quality.

**Markers of good code:**

* Clean, Consistent, Functional, or Useful—the code should do what it says it will do
* Easy to understand for users, not just its author
* Efficient—good code is succinct
* Testable—good code should be tested to be free of bugs or defects
* Easy to maintain Easy to build upon, reuse or replicate in the future
* Well documented—well written and adheres to agreed-upon standards or a style guide
