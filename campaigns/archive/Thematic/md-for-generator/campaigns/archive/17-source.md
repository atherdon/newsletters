# Cybersecurity tips when working from home

Pandemic-induced [remote worker boom](https://hackernoon.com/the-state-of-data-privacy-in-2020-21523yyk) seems to be making a comeback.  With the number of remote workers to [double in 2021](https://hackernoon.com/tagged/data-privacy), looks like it will be the [new normal for us](https://hackernoon.com/is-there-a-middle-ground-between-privacy-and-convenience-f6eo322s).  Although this migration worked fine as a band-aid, the implementation of remote working takes more than expected (and this is [not about children interrupting](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-protect-online-privacy-easy-steps-for-daily-activities-bet32a7) a BBC news interview, although this one’s epic). 

To make a remote job situation work, you [need a structured approach](https://hackernoon.com/privacy-protection-and-web3-analytics-ro1p3yga). And [robust cybersecurity](https://hackernoon.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-privacy-and-security-tools-zw463tsm) is what keeps your [digital environment](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-develop-a-human-centric-security-policy-j6h037wk) and your [company’s business safe](https://hackernoon.com/try-these-steps-for-increasing-privacy-and-security-on-windows-10-cn673tzg). This is why we’ve curated a list of vital [cybersecurity tips](https://hackernoon.com/tagged/privacy) that will help you mitigate risks and stay aware of [security vulnerabilities](https://www.hackernoon.com/how-developers-should-invest-their-time-2e1b3uww).


## Use strong passwords

Let’s face it: setting ‘beefstew1’ as your password [is not stroganoff](https://hackernoon.com/4-privacy-tips-for-distance-learning-students-g6g3u8s). You should never underestimate the [power of strong passwords](https://hackernoon.com/the-best-privacy-focused-browsers-in-2019-13xa2sp2). Long and unique passwords are utterly important – they [provide essential protection from hacking and identity theft](https://hackernoon.com/what-being-an-army-ranger-taught-me-about-being-a-project-manager-4m133eby). With that being said, avoid using the following combinations:



*   any guessed combinations like 12345 (is it still a thing?)
*   any string with sequential numbers or letters; (ABCDEFG – like, for real?)
*   any pseudo confidential combinations like your birth date or address (Gone are the days when the most sensitive information on a phone was contact names and phone numbers.)
*   adjacent keyboard combinations

And remember: whatever password your go for, never store your [list of passwords on your device in plain text](https://hackernoon.com/tagged/facebook-privacy). Also, 2-step verification is a great [anti-hacking measure](https://hackernoon.com/how-is-anonymous-view-different-from-private-mode-8pr3twr), serving as an additional layer of security.


## Use business devices (if possible)

Okay, this one’s [a bit controversial](https://www.hackernoon.com/illusion-of-choice-you-arent-deciding-how-important-your-privacy-is-d65q3tfi). Undoubtedly, using business devices at home creates an [additional security threat](https://hackernoon.com/thanks-facebook-now-we-all-know-why-privacy-is-important-fccd630d73d1) – and [that is unauthorized use](https://hackernoon.com/artificial-intelligence-and-online-privacy-blessing-and-a-curse-8k1r3tap). However, since the pandemic cracked open, people are less likely to have somebody over, so this con is leveled off.

In general, personal laptops tend to have [weaker security controls](https://hackernoon.com/security-for-pms-how-to-part-ii-oa1j3tm7) than your company-issued devices. Therefore, a remote worker cannot be sure whether the [device has been affected](https://hackernoon.com/what-about-the-illusion-of-choice-jz1r3wyd). And once a newly-minted remote specialist [signs in remotely to corporate networks](https://hackernoon.com/great-news-about-self-regulation-in-vpn-industry-i2coalitions-vti-essentials-hzk3t01) and uses [cloud-based applications](https://hackernoon.com/zero-trust-architecture-security-decoded-kl1g3wvd?source=rss), the [whole business gets infected in mere seconds](https://hackernoon.com/what-could-have-prevented-2020s-massive-twitter-hack-zm2m3ud8).

If use of personal equipment cannot be avoided, make sure to keep [data protection measures](https://hackernoon.com/my-rights-to-privacy-8bbeb93dc8d2) close to [office security standards](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-make-an-internal-employee-survey-on-endpoint-security-vo103tag) (at least, [install an anti-virus](https://hackernoon.com/tagged/online-privacy), for god’s sake!).

 


## A phish is still a phish even at home

With many companies around the globe rolling out work-from-home arrangements, cybercriminals are already [looking to cash in on the trend](https://hackernoon.com/amazon-engineer-jackson-kelley-is-working-on-data-privacy-in-alexa-op723tym).  Typically, [phishing emails](https://hackernoon.com/a-beginners-guide-to-the-dark-web-and-online-anonymity-2p2j3uwi) will target remote workers in a bid to get hold of [their personal data](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-handle-eu-data-without-the-eu-us-privacy-shield-framework-co3t3uwr) or get access to company accounts. Thus, in one phishing campaign featured by security researchers at [Minecast Threat Intelligence,](https://www.mimecast.com/content/threat-intelligence/) [cybercriminals](https://hackernoon.com/why-we-should-all-care-about-privacy-onlineinterview-tutanotas-hanna-bozakov-07193uga) are sending out remote workers a [credential-stealing scam](https://hackernoon.com/detecting-and-preventing-insider-threats-to-your-company-an-overview-hw3r3wp0) that [takes employees](https://hackernoon.com/4-strategies-to-enhance-employee-engagement-vi1i3tta) to a [fake OneDrive login](https://www.hackernoon.com/12-ways-to-create-the-best-working-environments-for-devs-561j3t13). Cybercriminals are using COVID-19 as a subject matter for this phishing scam.

Even if you follow a link and end up on a legitimate-looking site, make sure to check its trustworthiness before giving out any [personal data](https://hackernoon.com/amazon-engineer-jackson-kelley-is-working-on-data-privacy-in-alexa-op723tym). Ideally, [limit your online visits](https://hackernoon.com/7-basic-tips-for-surfing-the-internet-safely-ux3j3uof) to your go-to websites and don’t give away your credentials like it’s a party flyer. After all, you don’t come up to the strangers in the street and blurt out your card details, do you?


## The Takeaway

Whether you're a [work-from-home](https://hackernoon.com/easiest-guide-to-keep-your-zoom-meetings-safe-from-zoombombing-5f1j3uuw) pro or banished from the office due to the pandemic, make sure you are [able to handle cyber threats](https://community.hackernoon.com/t/ask-me-anything-with-ax-sharma-security-researcher-and-noonies-nominee/55445/13) stemming from remote work. Whereas, your company is accountable for the necessary infrastructure and [applicable security guidelines](https://hackernoon.com/securing-sensitive-customer-information-in-the-age-of-data-yfl3wgv) and plans, try [to minimize your exposure to cybersecurity risks](https://hackernoon.com/main-security-concepts-and-the-importance-of-data-privacy-mg8o3ur3), from your part. We hope that with these practices you can get started with making your home office running in a safe way.
