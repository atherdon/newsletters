# 913 Tech Company News Pages on Hacker Noon
Hacker Noon is proud to release Tech Company News Page. As the [lead developer on this project](https://hackernoon.com/u/massif), I gathered and integrated some valuable information about each of the 913 companies, utilizing Algolia and 3rd-party APIs like Bing News and BigPicture.io. The company news page is built with [Next.js](https://hackernoon.com/search?query=nextjs) which was the best choice due to its static generation and caching capabilities. Adding [Tech Company News Pages](https://hackernoon.com/companies) to Hacker Noon will add value to our visitors by providing them the most recent information about their favorite companies and brands. It will also add value to companies and brands by enabling them to enhance their brand awareness and provide the most accurate information about their brands.

We now have 913 Tech Company News Pages on Hacker Noon (also check out the first 22 tech company news pages). We want to grow it to tens of thousands more to cover as many businesses as we can. We hope you like them. If you'd like to have us create your company's tech company news page, edit an existing company news page, or publish your company statements with Hacker Noon, please fill out our brief tech company news page form.
