# Debug Your Coding Career

*Coders are gonna code. Newbies are gonna noob.*

We've all been there: Embracing our **[career journey](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-choose-between-a-career-in-frontend-vs-backend-u44q33dw)** as newly-minted specialists.

Thinking that we know it all—sometimes skipping the research and planning stages of a project due to excitement. Often afraid to raise questions to avoid looking silly.

Climbing up the company ladder is filled with embarrassing moments. Sadly, the nuanced mishaps of other people are seldom discussed in introductory seminars.

Which is why we created a guide from the experiences of the developers that we have heard about. Below are some of the most popular career mistakes that can slow your career growth.

# **Sticking with One Company for too Long**

There’s a fine line between establishing tenure to show that you’re not a job hopper and settling way too deep into your comfort zone.

[Developers](https://hackernoon.com/i-got-a-job-as-a-developer-at-16-and-you-can-too-xg2q31ls) who have built their careers at one company may find themselves unmotivated to achieve more. The longer you stay a 'one-trick-pony,' the more your skills and pay may hibernate, potentially rendering your job experience bleak.

# Having too Many Job Changes

If you have many non-contract, full-time jobs that last a few months, it's also a warning signal –regardless of why you left.

Although perceptions of job-hopping are shifting, employers still frown on developers who are constantly switching companies.

The reason for that is that it takes time to become more knowledgeable and acquainted with the business and the **[codebase](https://hackernoon.com/getting-familiar-with-a-new-codebase-szg23y8m)**. Apart from that, you need far more than a couple of months to dig deeper into the end-user needs that your **[software](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-evaluate-software-code-quality-and-why-it-is-important-ldn3whh)** addresses.

# Focusing on a Single Technology

Being a master of one **[stack](https://hackernoon.com/a-web-stack-is-like-a-pile-of-books-5w2l35to)** may make you irreplaceable to your current employer.  But should you remain permanently loyal until **[innovation](https://hackernoon.com/the-future-of-innovation-how-will-entrepreneurs-adapt-to-this-decade-78fq3477)** renders your skills moot? *Debatable.*

We’re not implying that you should keep chasing newer technologies with no ROI.

The truth is that you won’t find any modern **[software development](https://hackernoon.com/an-innovative-way-to-price-your-software-development-work-4l1e33ps)** role which calls for only one technology for the length of your career.

However, pressing on with one stack can be limiting if you want to step into *the corporate environment.*

# Underestimating the Role of Soft Skills

Being excellent at **[writing code](https://hackernoon.com/things-you-need-to-learn-before-you-start-writing-code-2rm33jc)** is not enough to claim that great, high-paying job you desire.

Even though getting a hold of [the **latest technologies**](https://hackernoon.com/mind-mapping-creative-thinking-and-the-augmented-reality-ar-technologies-driving-them-5j2h3zau) is of crucial value in this business, soft skills are equally important for a developer.

What’s the point in your excellent command of **[Java](https://hackernoon.com/java-vs-php-what-to-choose-in-2021-6t1133px)** or **[Python](https://hackernoon.com/a-guide-to-improving-your-python-performance-speed-th2835dj)** if you lack **[communication](https://hackernoon.com/17-skills-improve-managerial-communication-in-the-workplace-4c2e35le)** abilities and struggle to showcase your value to the company? After all, you’ll have to gather requirements for the software you are creating.

The good news is that soft skills are not innate abilities. Therefore, you can whip your communication, leadership, or time management abilities into shape with due diligence.

# On the Road to Success

The tech industry is forever crying out for talent and so it may seem that your dream employer is around every **[Internet](https://hackernoon.com/the-problem-with-centralized-internet-qy1r35q0)** corner.

But the talent shortage doesn’t mean there aren’t a great number of bright minds vying for their career. Therefore, living, eating, and breathing **[code](https://hackernoon.com/writing-proper-code-is-vital-heres-why-cst3ti5)** is *no longer your lucky break.*
