Introduction from [BENZINGA](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/21/04/20472667/slogging-blockchain-and-innovations-in-crowdsourced-content-interview-with-founder-of-hack):

*Founded in 2016, [HackerNoon](https://hackernoon.com/) is an independent technology media publishing platform founded and run by [David Smooke](https://hackernoon.com/u/David) and [Linh Dao Smooke](https://hackernoon.com/u/linh). The site works with an innovative approach to crowdsourcing content — and publishes about 30 stories per day. That, along with a certain editorial point of view and personality on tech stories, has garnered a loyal following.*

*David Smooke, CEO & Founder of HackerNoon, said in an interview on the **[Growth Manifesto](https://www.growthmanifesto.com/podcast/davidsmooke)** podcast: “…Our model is contributors own their content, and they give it a non-exclusive license to HackerNoon, and we can edit and distribute it. <…>it’s between social media and traditional publishing. If you publish on Forbes, it’s a lot of pitching; it’s a lot of back and forth, it’s kind of a clunky login and submission of content. So having a good contributor experience is there, but every post goes through a second human, and there are quality control issues, there are content improvement efforts, so that’s like just a better experience. I think the [second human rule](https://sponsor.hackernoon.com/blog/why-your-story-benefits-from-the-second-human-rule) is something; everyone should use when they post online.”*

*The site is also known for its approach to technology — with its founders focused on long-term growth and the best way to answer publishing challenges.While most traditional publications struggle for leadership, the Smookes are blazing new trails and looking at new ways to tackle challenges.*

*When HackerNoon separated from Medium, instead of building on WordPress or Moveable Type or any other standard content management platform, HackerNoon built its own tool to allow for growth.*

*When they wanted [an emoji system](https://e27.co/how-hackernoon-uses-customer-centric-approach-to-build-meaningful-new-features-on-their-platform-20200830/) to like, laugh, smile, etc., at specific images and lines, it was created on blockchain as a way to track comments.*

**What is the idea behind slogging?**

*[“Slogging” — a portmanteau of Slack and Blogging](https://www.slogging.com/) — is their new innovative content effort and a new way to think of crowdsourcing your remote team’s chatter.*

*Why waste the witty banter — and the occasional sudden insight — on the depths of your slack archives, when you can turn them into publishable content?*

**[Slogging](https://www.slogging.com/)**, or Slack Blogging, emerged from **[HackerNoon](https://hackernoon.com/)**’s internal use of Slack. Looking back on the last year, our tech lead had published 30,000+ Slack updates but only 12 HackerNoon posts. So we made an application for tech leaders to convert insightful Slack discussions into well-formatted HackerNoon posts.
