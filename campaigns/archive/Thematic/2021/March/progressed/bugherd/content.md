In today’s [digital era](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-take-screenshots-in-the-browser-using-javascript-l92k3xq7), if your business does not have a website, consider it dead. And if you do have a company website, the last thing you want to grapple with is a fast and sleek digital platform plagued by bugs.

Yep, those nasty little flaws that can lead to the loss of revenue and even damage the reputation of your brand. Fortunately, bug tracking tools are swooping in to help, pushing old-hat spreadsheets into the background.

On that note, let's review some of the top benefits you can reap from issue trackers besides the actual bug hunting:

## Better organization

What’s the point of having an [excellent reporting system](https://hackernoon.com/i-built-a-personal-faq-directory-on-how-to-get-into-producttech-x6613unw) on bugs reported but not being able to manage tasks? An effective website bug tracker should help you [streamline this process for your team](https://hackernoon.com/learn-how-to-reset-team-productivity-with-these-5-steps-ewe3u08) and external stakeholders.

In this case, it allows the [team to convert](https://hackernoon.com/storm-to-perform-the-4-stages-of-team-productivity-b47370c5ab17) the tasks into feedback, categorize issues into lists, and [assign these to responsible stakeholders](https://hackernoon.com/5-powerful-ways-to-boost-your-remote-team-productivity-br1u34fh).

## Integrate with other tools

Your company is most likely using a gamut of [management tools](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-hack-your-team-top-5-tools-for-team-management-automation-in-2021-sw6231xd). So it seems logical enough that the [website issue tracking tool](https://hackernoon.com/7-best-product-design-tools-every-team-should-consider-z84434c4) should be integrated into your workflow [seamlessly](https://hackernoon.com/easily-distracted-download-these-6-apps-8x1qq3zyj). That makes it more convenient to import and export the action points and details related to these tasks into and from other tools.

## Progress monitoring

Being able to pinpoint and rank website issues in a system is not enough. To estimate the timeline for website development, you should also be able to [track the progress](https://hackernoon.com/i-built-a-habit-tracker-tool-in-notion-heres-my-template-pp14332v).

If your team consists of multiple developers and designers assigned to a web development project, then bug tracking software can help you [track who is responsible](https://hackernoon.com/i-built-an-online-subscription-tracker-app-in-codaheres-the-template-oo7n32nz) for completing a particular task or the time spent on putting out any proverbial fires.

[This measure is not about spying on your team members](https://hackernoon.com/how-an-employee-productivity-tracker-enhances-performance-fgm3w1s), but instead it helps you to [optimize mutual performance](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-create-a-habit-tracker-in-notion-b5143uzn) and stay in the loop. Additionally, this feature will allow your company to navigate the terrain of timelines and budgets.

## Better communication and connectivity

Website bug tracking software facilitates stable communication and helps [transform feedback into tasks and action items](https://hackernoon.com/5-best-practices-for-keeping-a-new-product-on-track-909bead2d2c5).

With [task collaboration](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-choose-the-team-collaboration-software-n3133u27), built-in chat, and email notifications, a bug tracking software keeps everyone on the same wavelength, [eliminates communication gaps](https://hackernoon.com/6-effective-work-collaboration-tools-for-remote-communication-2v5q32kd), and [improves transparency and accountability](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-increase-team-productivity-tu17438dc).

As a result, teams allocate [more time to brainstorming](https://hackernoon.com/software-has-taken-away-the-human-element-lets-get-it-back-h1223vcu) and troubleshooting issues rather than frittering away hours on pointless laying of blame.

## Notifications

When a team is knee-deep in work, they might not necessarily [get a notification about an update](https://hackernoon.com/our-take-on-non-annoying-notifications-for-collaboration-tools-8163d4604abe), which runs the risk of issues remaining unaddressed. 

Website bug trackers help to [stay on top of things](https://hackernoon.com/notifications-continuous-distraction-f1cae0051632) by providing an alert anytime someone makes changes. [These updates keep all stakeholders in the loop](https://hackernoon.com/my-path-to-six-billion-notifications-sent-0wpc37fj) and on the [same page](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-use-mulesoft-to-send-slack-notifications-when-data-changes-tz2s34vc) with the current status of each task and prevents overlapping of tasks and resources.

## The Takeaway
