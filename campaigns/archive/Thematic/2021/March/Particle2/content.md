Over the last decade, the [Internet of Things](https://hackernoon.com/basic-use-cases-of-ai-ml-deep-learning-and-internet-of-things-4u8g36hr) has been [delivering](https://hackernoon.com/14-iot-adoption-challenges-that-enterprises-need-to-overcome-jl213wgs) heaps of data and [remote device control](https://hackernoon.com/the-tactile-internet-a-new-iot-by1134od) across virtually [every industry](https://hackernoon.com/everyday-use-of-internet-of-things-iot-internet-of-things-iot-is-the-inter-connectivity-of-comp-f7n34xr), from healthcare to hospitality.

Today, [IoT is a new paradigm](https://hackernoon.com/the-growth-of-internet-of-things-effective-technology-opportunities-677f322m) touted to be the new stage in the information evolution with eventual [societal transformation](https://hackernoon.com/how-internet-of-things-is-changing-things-at-the-workplace-29a4fe945449) that will [challenge the Internet itself](https://hackernoon.com/is-the-internet-of-things-going-to-steal-your-job-b0114aa109ef). [Connected devices](https://hackernoon.com/a-beginners-guide-to-home-automation-with-the-internet-of-things-iot-rx3p345g) have already taken over the world and accounts for over 10 billion IoT [connected hardware](https://hackernoon.com/how-internet-of-things-iot-is-transforming-the-future-business-landscape-e6ef7fea5b2b).

But let’s step back a little bit here and [look beyond the fine print](https://hackernoon.com/iot-security-challenges-and-risk-mitigation-strategies-2fhf311m). If we read between the lines in any IoT-related article, there is a [huge red flag](https://hackernoon.com/5-effective-ways-to-handle-iot-security-challenges-11y3461) flying tacked to the IoT revolution - a conveyor-belt of ethical issues.

Namely, [security and privacy](https://hackernoon.com/why-iot-security-is-only-as-good-as-the-weakest-link-ul3d3ut8) are among the top [frequently raised ethical concerns developers see in IoT](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-secure-healthcare-facilities-against-iot-security-threats-ab28dd284cac).

From [smart security cameras](https://hackernoon.com/how-does-triple-a-approach-to-iot-security-work-an-overview-em8e30z0) sending stills from other people’s homes to who-knows-where, to [baby monitors being hacked](https://hackernoon.com/quantum-lock-and-next-super-secure-applicationsquantum-lock-fd1w321e), there are a [myriad examples](https://hackernoon.com/countering-iot-security-issues-an-enterprise-guide-8cfef499fc92) of IoT devices that sport [dismal security](https://hackernoon.com/5-guidelines-to-ensure-iot-security-12d24ac34925).

On the heels of [privacy breaches](https://hackernoon.com/smart-cities-cybersecurity-in-the-era-of-iot-6p103zsi), a staggering number of IoT-powered devices have little to no robust [information security](https://hackernoon.com/privacy-security-concerns-grow-for-wearables-677b70afa6e0). And might we remind you that [informational security](https://hackernoon.com/data-is-now-a-luxury-good-heres-why-it-shouldnt-be-v4oy3wpr) has instrumental value as it safeguards other moral values as well.

So, the [underlying problem](https://hackernoon.com/big-tech-is-acquiring-access-to-your-health-and-home-9m163xiz) here is that smartphones may exchange data with remote and obscure data receivers. And these can process the data and circulate the final results bona fide and [without the user’s consent](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-defend-your-smart-home-against-hackers-4x5f36jh). (We see you, smart TVs).

And at the height of it all, the [Internet of Things](https://hackernoon.com/monetization-models-use-cases-and-business-opportunities-of-iot-solutions-hw6835uu) can become a [headwind force](https://hackernoon.com/iot-in-healthcare-benefits-and-examples-nq1b31dp) in [closing the gap](https://hackernoon.com/how-i-converted-my-manual-hand-crank-desk-into-an-iot-desk-part-1-bu263whx) between the rich and poor. Unintentionally, this [innovative technology](https://hackernoon.com/adding-iot-to-my-home-office-desk-part-2-bn183wj6) can stack the deck against certain groups of people that still do not have Internet access.

There are many regions and lower-income families that do not have [Wi-Fi and hardware](https://hackernoon.com/iot-projects-build-a-robust-iot-prototype-in-less-than-a-day-part-1-iz1034d5), so they will not be able to [take advantage of the IoT benefits](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-build-a-robust-iot-prototype-in-less-than-a-day-part-2-eb183119).

If we recognize these issues ahead of time, and act on it, there is a strong likelihood that we’ll have the opportunity to prevent the ethical dilemmas that accompany this technology.
