# Crypto and Passive Income - What’s the Deal?

Your mum is asking about it. Governments are [resisting it](https://hackernoon.com/bitcoin-adoption-where-do-the-countries-stand-rg4n33w3). Industries are [innovating with it](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2021/02/09/how-blockchain-technology-is-helping-companies-solve-operational-issues/). Elon Musk is shamelessly [tweeting about it](https://www.coindesk.com/dogecoin-takes-off-after-musk-moonshot).

Unless you’ve been on a digital diet for the past year, it’s very likely you’ve heard about Bitcoin and/or cryptocurrency generally. You might even _hate _hearing about it by now. Unfortunately for you then, the market cap for cryptocurrency has surpassed $2 trillion dollars, making it even more topical (and divisive).

So whether you’re happy it’s yet again entering the mainstream consciousness, Bitcoin - and the decentralised finance (DeFi) industry blossoming around it - is here to stay.

There are billions in [total value locked in the DeFi economy](https://defipulse.com/) alone. In less than one year, it has grown by 5000%, now reaching over $52 billion.

But despite the overwhelming influx of new interest and investment, decentralized finance is far from perfect. Thankfully, its flaws are not systematic human greed or corruption, or inequality and exclusivity. Its issues are mostly on the technical and social side, and so in theory will be resolved over time and with [more participation](https://hackernoon.com/is-it-time-for-defi-to-go-mainstream-after-the-gamestop-craze-ob2c33yg).

One of these fixable flaws of the crypto economy is a lack of liquidity.** **And** **you** **can help provide it, making the market stronger and earning passive income at the same time. 

Now is a great time to become a liquidity provider and earn some passive income. The industry is scaling fast and supply needs to meet fast-growing demands. To help grow the decentralized [economy](https://hackernoon.com/societies-and-decentralized-systems-have-a-lot-in-common-kd5533v2), many projects offer incentives or rewards for crypto holders to contribute their funds (supply liquidity) and help sustain this fast growing ecosystem.

One popular incentive is through [liquidity mining](https://hackernoon.com/defi-and-crypto-passive-income-how-to-get-started-1m3w33pz). Our friends at Mysterium are currently running a liquidity engagement [campaign](https://mysterium.network/blog/switch-to-polygon-join-our-quickswap-liquidity-campaign/), which is an easy way to get your feet wet in the DeFi economy and receive rewards when you participate.

A fluid economy is a powerful one, opening up new financial opportunities and freedom for everyone - not just the upper echelon of Wall Street bros. So [learn more about DeFi](https://app.hackernoon.com/drafts/BLrT8nhyu12Pa6VMwVz8) passive income and maybe discover (or rekindle) a new relationship with crypto &lt;3
