# Ghost the Internet Like It Is Your Ex

There are some pairs in life that just make sense. Melted cheese and toast. Netflix and chill.

And cryptocurrency and VPNs.

They share all the best characteristics that modern web technology can offer - censorship-resistant, private and secure. Combine your VPN with crypto payments and the result is a truly anonymous and global browsing experience.

We all know how important a VPN is in our modern digital world. At least a quarter of the world’s internet users rely on one. Go without it and risk identity fraud, hacked Facebook accounts or missing the latest season of your favorite show.

A VPN is the easiest way to bypass snooping eyes and [geo-blocked content](https://hackernoon.com/geo-blocking-should-be-illegal-change-my-mind-ig84335t). Unfortunately, [regular VPNs are still hackable](https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/whats-the-truth-about-the-nordvpn-breach-heres-what-we-now-know#:~:text=The%20hack%20affected%20a%20single,we%20were%20never%20notified%20of.), which is a real bummer since they store logs of your browsing history centrally.

A crypto VPN like Mysterium [functions similarly to Tor](https://hackernoon.com/decentralized-vpn-the-evolution-of-tor-hkv3uix), which means it’s technologically impossible to store logs centrally. It’s built on a global [peer-to-peer network](https://hackernoon.com/why-the-p2p-resurgence-is-the-step-backwards-the-internet-desperately-needs-fz2u3e7j), so just like crypto, it’s powered by the very people who use it. These P2P communities are becoming the foundation of the [decentralized web](https://hackernoon.com/the-splinternet-is-coming-and-how-decentralization-can-stitch-it-all-back-together-again-2u8232wc), so you can also take part and [start earning crypto](https://mysterium.network/node/) when you share your unused bandwidth with others in need.

Cryptocurrencies are the perfect fit for a VPN, making your browsing habits even more untraceable and unblockable. And paying with crypto also means you can pay-as-you-go by the minute, even if it’s less than one cent! Unlike your average VPN, there are no locked-in costs and no bank cards. With a crypto wallet address, you don’t even need an email address to register, so you can switch on and off any time. Just top up your crypto account in seconds and start unblocking worldwide content.
