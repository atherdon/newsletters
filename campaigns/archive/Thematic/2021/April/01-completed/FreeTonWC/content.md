As part of this partnership, we're launching the **[decentralized internet writing competition.](https://hackernoon.com/decentralized-internet-writing-contest?ref=hackernoon.com)**

**$3,500 in monthly prize money will be distributed to the winners of this contest and the entry criterion is simple**: _Anyone who publishes on the [#decentralized-internet](https://hackernoon.com/tagged/decentralized-internet?ref=hackernoon.com) tag on HackerNoon will be entered to win a monthly prize._

While [Free TON](https://freeton.org/?ref=hackernoon.com) is sponsoring this contest, Hacker Noon is technology agnostic and we are open to any and all story submissions that cover the who, what, when, where, why, and how of decentralizing the internet.

**I've said it before and I'll say it again and again**:

_less dependency on central entities is essential for the internet to mature into a technology that works for the people using it._
