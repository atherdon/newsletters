# Why NoSQL For Startups

Arriving in the new decade, we are witnessing a new era of databases. Since the amount of data has gone from terabytes to petabytes, classic RDBMS cannot effectively manage this avalanche of information anymore. To handle this problem, traditional RDBMS were complemented by NoSQL databases. The latter has already made a dent in the market with projected revenue of [$22,087 million](https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/NoSQL-market#:~:text=NoSQL%20Market%20Statistics%20%2D%202026,31.4%25%20from%202019%20to%202026.) by 2026. 

Today, we’re here to find out how a [NoSQL database](https://hackernoon.com/nosql-a-brief-history-and-the-dynamodb-challenge-7c2u34b8) can help you deal with the data flow, and why it’s a safe bet for startups.

If you’re just starting [your business journey](https://hackernoon.com/startups-are-thriving-in-la-its-an-entrepreneurial-hot-spot-jp5q355v), your involuntary impulse must be a SQL solution. However, unless you can afford to provision the infrastructure for your relational database, it’s recommended to choose a NoSQL database for your first flight.

_But...why?_

NoSQL improves the capacity to [apply rapid and agile development workflow](https://hackernoon.com/implementing-a-distributed-multi-document-acid-transactions-in-couchbase-a-how-to-guide-pt1y33jy). And we all know that startups prefer a product that can see the world and can be cashed on as quickly as possible. Thanks to a schema-less nature, NoSQL databases welcome tweaks to record structures without a whimper.  

Secondly, as your [startup](https://hackernoon.com/tagged/startups) makes headway, a NoSQL database has the capacity to accompany your business journey. This solution usually comes complete with change-friendly schemas that facilitate faster and more iterative development. Also, NoSQLs do not limit data types. So if you have to handle semi-structured and unstructured data pumping in from different sources, they’re the right call. This also means that the users will be able to add more types of data as your business needs evolve. Do we say yes to the [enhanced flexibility](https://hackernoon.com/synchronized-drawing-apps-with-couchbase-and-xamarin-lf53a30jt) of NoSQL databases? We definitely do.

Among other things, brand new businesses flock to NoSQL thanks to its simplicity in implementation. The ease-of-use allows for someone with a plain understanding to muddle through a NoSQL instead of grappling with mapping your data structures. Also, a shallow knowledge curve can potentially obviate the need for a specific Database Administrator early on. Ever-budget-constrained startups will surely [appreciate](https://hackernoon.com/couchbase-mobile-the-power-of-nosql-on-the-edge-dkdhx30jl) this paycheck-saving bonus. 

_Startups make a dart for steady growth and new investments every day. They are operating under the condition of a continuous scramble to avoid cash burnout. Can a traditional rigid database support [this mad workflow](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-query-json-in-couchbase-via-collections-and-scopes-3p1l3ze8)? It probably can. However, a NoSQL database is adaptable from the word go and ready for rapid development like no other solution._
