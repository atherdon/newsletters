As part of this partnership, we're launching the **[decentralized internet writing competition.](https://hackernoon.com/decentralized-internet-writing-contest?ref=hackernoon.com)**

**$3,500 in monthly prize money will be distributed to the winners of this contest and the entry criterion is simple**: _Anyone who publishes on the [#decentralized-internet](https://hackernoon.com/tagged/decentralized-internet?ref=hackernoon.com) tag on HackerNoon will be entered to win a monthly prize._

While [Free TON](https://freeton.org/?ref=hackernoon.com) is sponsoring this contest, Hacker Noon is technology agnostic and we are open to any and all story submissions that cover the who, what, when, where, why, and how of decentralizing the internet.

**I've said it before and I'll say it again and again**:

_less dependency on central entities is essential for the internet to mature into a technology that works for the people using it._

## **Contest Rules and Guidelines**

Below are the rules, guidelines, and FAQs about the competition.

**Who can enter the contest?**

You must be 18+ to enter. There are no location restrictions, you can enter the contest from anywhere in the world.  

**Do I have to post under my real name?**

Real names can add validity, but meritocracy trumps all. If you[ create a new Hacker Noon account](https://hackernoon.com/signup?ref=hackernoon.com) under a pseudonym and if you are a finalist, we’ll contact you privately to award your prize. 

**What can I write about?**

Almost anything under the sun, as long as it follows [Hacker Noon’s general submission guidelines.](https://www.notion.so/hackernoon/Your-Complete-Guide-to-Writing-for-Hacker-Noon-0c98e26f52e3429bb9daad74a7ed12a5?ref=hackernoon.com) 

**How long will the contest run?**

The contest will run every month for the rest of 2021. Prizes are awarded at the beginning of the next month. 


## **How we Select Finalists and Distribute the Prize Money**

At Hacker Noon, everyone’s a winner! … except when we have limited prizes to give out. In that case, only four people can be winners each month.

**Four winners will be selected at the end of each month.** A monthly prize pool of **$3,500 **(fair market value, paid in TON crystals. Get your wallet[ here](https://freeton.house/en/ton-crystal-wallet-free-ton-wallet-from-broxus/)) will be distributed amongst them in the following manner:



*   Winner for best story gets **$1,500**
*   First Runner-up gets **$1,000**
*   Second Runner-up gets **$500**
*   Third Runner-up gets **$500**

Every month from the 13 posts with the most traffic, Hacker Noon editors will vote on the four best stories. Other than cash, you also win the prestige of being published on Hacker Noon and have a cool new project, or suite of projects, to add to your amazing portfolio.

**Can I submit more than one entry to the contest?**

Yes. Contestants can submit as many #decentralized-internet stories as they want each month. The more the merrier; the more you submit, the more chances you have of winning. 

However, you can only win 1 prize per month. For example, if you submit three amazing stories in 1 month, we will choose the best one to award you for. 

**If I already won a prize, can I still enter the next session?**

Yes. Even if you won a prize in the first month of the contest, feel free to submit more entries every month throughout the duration of the contest.
