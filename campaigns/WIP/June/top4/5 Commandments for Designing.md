I watched a smiling young lady tossing the tiny [nect MODEM](https://nectmodem.com/?ref=hackernoon.com), awed that her products are awarded three Red Dots (already!), marked best on Clutch and [CES](https://www.ces.tech/?ref=hackernoon.com), featured on Mashable, and sold at Apple stores. Meet Evgeniya - an experienced and tech-savvy Head of Design at Concepter.

[This year’s winner](https://www.red-dot.org/project/nect-modem-48506?ref=hackernoon.com) is a tiny 4G portable modem created with the idea of helping people jump to work in a cafe or hotel, while commuting, while traveling, or working from home — each time enjoying a stable, fast and secure internet connection.

In terms of hardware design, it meant:

- Fitting all electronic components needed for 4G LTE power and a nano-SIM slot into a little sexy box with the dimensions of 7*7*1 sm.
- Making the device charge from a laptop.
- Making it attach to the laptop easily and, at the same time, firmly so that users can confidently stuff laptops with the modems into their bags.

This is a challenging task, and a young startup didn't only make its crowdfunding campaign a success but also won the Red Dot Award 2020 for the high quality of design.

This article is an exclusive conversation with award-winning designer Evgeniya Medvedeva about the industrial design and design contests. Here are her insights, along with the intriguing predictions about what’s next in the world of product design.
