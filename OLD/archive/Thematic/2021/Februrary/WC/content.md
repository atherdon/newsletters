While you can find out more about action lines [here](https://hackernoon.com/introducing-the-velo-writing-contest-by-wix-and-hacker-noon-ta3433v0?source=rss), we’ll touch upon the main points.

First of all, the only restriction is that you *must be of age* to enter the competition. Your expertise and hands-on experience can go from a coding guru to a complete amateur enthusiast. Also, you can be based in any part of the world - it really doesn’t matter.

As for your entry creation, you’re not limited in your artistic freedom as long as you follow Hacker Noon’s general submission guidelines. Basically, keep it SFW: building a Tinder clone is A-OK, but don’t use Velo to break into the adult film industry.

The contest will run for a total of 3 months: **March 1st to May 31st, 2021**, with prizes awarded at the end of each month.

NB! The first round will run until March 31st and we will start accepting submissions on February 20th.

As much as we want to credit every talented developer out there, we will select only 10 winners at the end of each month and distribute a monthly prize pool of $4250. The good news is that contestants can submit as many Velo stories as they want each month. However, you can only win 1 prize per month.

So these are all key points to mention there but make sure you’ll study contest rules and guidelines in more detail. 

Well, best of luck to you all!
