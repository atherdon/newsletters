Hey There Hackers,

Thank you for joining our Slogging channel! We hope you’ve had a chance to share your thoughts on some active threads and perhaps even started some of your own.

Slogging was created to help foster a stronger Hacker Noon contributor community, help us learn more about each other, and help each other grow.

For those same reasons, we’ve decided to launch daily AMAs via Slogging’s [#AMAS channel](https://slogging.slack.com/archives/C01D94MM0VB). They will be hosted **every weekday at 12PM MT**. 

If you ever wanted to get an interview published on Hacker Noon, hosting your own AMA is the easiest way to do it.

**4 Easy Steps to Host Your Own Hacker Noon AMA**

1. DM one of the editors in the Slogging channel @: Limarc, Rianke, Amy, Natasha, Arthur
2. Include the following details: email address, desired dates, and your topic
3. Accept our calendar invite and show up at #AMAS on the confirmed date of the event
4. On the day of the event, [navigate to #AMAS](https://slogging.slack.com/archives/C01D94MM0VB) and type “Ask me Anything About TOPIC”, ex “Ask Me Anything About Python”. Then, just wait for the questions to roll in and answer them!

_Don’t forget to publish the Slogging post on Hacker Noon after you’re done!_

**How to Add AMAs to Your Calendar**

1. Navigate to our [AMA Calendar Notion board](https://www.notion.so/Slogging-AMA-Calendar-fba81581bcbb4472a940d31fb3e5814d). 
2. Scroll down to the Google Calendar
3. Select an AMA event you want to attend and click “copy to my calendar”

That’s it. We hope to see you at our next AMA. Better yet, we hope you slide into our DMs to schedule your first AMA!



See you on Slogging,
The Hacker Noon Editorial Team
