# Dillinger Investment in knowledge pays the best interest [part duo]

 [Distance learning](https://hackernoon.com/tagged/education) is a common practice in 2020, primarily due to quarantine. With [technology](https://hackernoon.com/tagged/technology), you can [listen to your lectures](https://hackernoon.com/tagged/self-improvement) while running, driving, cooking, or at the gym. Yes, it's less productive, but can be a significant first step forward.

I had an app for growing my English vocabulary. Usually, I used it after running while trying to sink in my bathtub. Better and more effective than just wasting time on Instagram, right? The same approach can help to [learn](https://hackernoon.com/learning-regex-basics-in-ruby-4qel3y5i) 
other things too.

And online lectures are more than just video + text content. 

[Interactive learning](https://hackernoon.com/my-experiments-and-how-to-start-with-machine-learning-fzh63yrk)  
with well-thought courses is on the rise. Even having 

[ tests online](https://hackernoon.com/flawed-education-school-system-does-not-translate-to-education-u0n33wvk) 
is a great thing. You can't cheat due to time limits, dude.

As a course creator, I can tell you that creating tests is very satisfying because students will get a certificate
[only if they pass it](https://hackernoon.com/65-key-takeaways-from-the-pragmatic-programmer-from-journeyman-to-master-1b4n32cy) 
 (more than 65% for example).

And as a teacher, I love to dominate students. So, start to learn, lazy ass, and be ready to struggle as I was struggling 10 years ago. Because you [can't beat machines](https://hackernoon.com/tagged/automation), so at least 
[get some help from it](https://hackernoon.com/tagged/future).

I have two friends. I shared my git [courses](https://hackernoon.com/these-are-the-best-courses-to-learn-new-java-features-from-jdk-8-to-jdk-13-9z7m33e9)  with both of them. One friend finished all the [classes](https://hackernoon.com/reasons-why-should-students-give-more-emphasis-on-derivatives-and-integrals-g01c3ypv)  . He battles with my pronunciation and stuff. Another one just skipped it. He knows everything! He doesn't have time for it. A busy bee. What do we have in the end?
The first one has a 
[better workflow](https://hackernoon.com/understanding-currying-closures-and-coupling-in-javascript-pg3x3y6z), and it's more [comfortable to work](https://hackernoon.com/20-best-courses-from-udemy-free-resource-center-to-learn-programming-and-coding-48873yjn) as a team member together. The second one, even with more skills and experience is just unpredictable. Like you need to buzz him on Slack to get an update, or review code by hands.

Very uncomfortable situation. What is the outcome for you? You [should learn your whole life](https://hackernoon.com/how-elon-musk-redesigned-school-for-his-children-o6di32kt) because this is one of the skills that will always [pay you back](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-choose-which-book-you-should-read-next-yw6l31gx).
Save more [money for education](https://hackernoon.com/the-importance-of-unlearning-emerging-technologies-v47c37f0), not for entertainment. Do it each month, from your savings. This is my investment advice.
# Blink if you working from home ;)
