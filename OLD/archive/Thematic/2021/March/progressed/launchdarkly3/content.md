# How DevOps Brings Out The Best In Developers

*Come to the Bright Side. We have a collaborative environment.*

[DevOps](https://hackernoon.com/devops-tools-that-will-help-in-rectifying-errors-in-the-databases-ti1w3u74) was officially coined in 2009, but its principles have been generating buzz since at least 2006. Along with [building up a base of advocates](https://hackernoon.com/adopt-a-devops-culture-before-looking-for-devops-engineers-do533uol), this innovative approach has been strongly lambasted for undermining the time-tested practices rooted in the [development processes](https://hackernoon.com/7-best-devops-security-practices-devsecops-and-its-merits-mr2p3unk).

But, [rather than being a nemesis to the traditional approach](https://hackernoon.com/the-difference-between-ci-and-cd-in-devops-bc2z3uae), the DevOps brings the entire application [development life cycle](https://hackernoon.com/why-devops-is-important-during-the-covid-19-pandemic-6u1i3tul) to a whole new level and fosters the [long-needed skills in developers](https://hackernoon.com/7-devops-myths-busted-02p3t1c).

## Educating Developers With DevOps

### DevOps helps developers and programmers to think automation

Before DevOps hit the spotlight, developers had to [commit the code](https://hackernoon.com/heres-how-we-train-our-devops-skills-internally-kl2y3wsv) after it had cleared the unit tests on particular machines. Thus, they didn’t have [‘a greater picture’](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-extend-your-devops-strategy-for-success-in-the-cloud-col3wee).

Today, developers can [get a broader view and go beyond everything](https://hackernoon.com/measuring-devops-metrics-a-how-to-guide-ot113ztl) that goes with clicking “Commit.” This also helps tech specialists to [get away from old-school ways](https://hackernoon.com/what-is-devops-and-how-does-it-influence-the-digital-transformation-of-companies-ik2e3wib) of doing everything manually, even if they are not particularly into [automated testing](https://hackernoon.com/adopting-devops-practises-to-bring-certainty-to-these-uncertain-times-i73h3wlp).

### A source of new skills

Back in 2014, the [DevOps model](https://hackernoon.com/the-importance-of-devops-in-mobile-app-development-xu2m3wyk) was strongly criticized for putting unnecessary additional pressure on developers. It was said that [DevOps deprived developers](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-implement-devops-for-e-commerce-companies-ub1s34ig) of being able to specialize in what they do best: [crafting code](https://hackernoon.com/devsecops-and-devops-a-deep-dive-j62k34r3).

The common picture associated with [DevOps in those times](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-cultivate-a-collaborative-devops-culture-ds1x334q) was an exhausted techie [running around](https://hackernoon.com/containers-vs-serverless-from-a-devops-standpoint-d8232bd0f39b) because he had to dabble in QA / testing, systems administration, database management, and whatever else.

In reality, the [DevOps model just expands the skill sets](https://hackernoon.com/top-15-basic-devops-interview-questions-2021-edition-d73u3451) that developers had to possess to succeed in their careers. 

Today, [even in companies that haven't leveraged DevOps](https://hackernoon.com/closer-than-you-think-bridging-the-devops-security-gap-st8d33fq), developers are [more accountable](https://hackernoon.com/devops-automation-tools-for-continuous-improvement-xo3w3y8v) than they were a decade ago for code (which is a bummer for unmotivated employees).

### You build it - you run it

It may seem as simple as the [person who generated the bug](https://hackernoon.com/future-of-devops-devsecops-aiops-and-something-else-2i8l36bn) should [own the problem end-to-end](https://hackernoon.com/when-dedicated-devops-is-not-available-lc763y8v), otherwise the team will just toss junk over the wall at the scapegoats. 

Within the [traditional approach](https://hackernoon.com/devops-fundamentals-you-ever-wanted-to-know-zt2m3uh6), developers often think their job is done when the product owner approves the ticket. So you might imagine the frustration when you can’t just shirk your buggy code and [pin it all on the other team players](https://hackernoon.com/what-is-the-impact-of-remote-work-on-devops-n8163eqa).

The [reality is that testing](https://hackernoon.com/devops-principles-culture-vs-tooling-vvac367z) on an [agile DevOps project](https://hackernoon.com/6-virtual-devops-conferences-to-attend-in-2021-qb133357) is performed by all the team members, including devs, testers, and ops people.

### Collaboration and transparency

In the [traditional developer and operations environment](https://hackernoon.com/the-top-10-books-on-devops-you-need-to-read-fuos312x), a developer writes a piece of code, assigns it to the island of QE, and then dumps it in the operations department. [There is little to no handshake in this lifecycle](https://hackernoon.com/why-is-devops-for-machine-learning-so-different-384z32f1). And if you mess up something, you can always say that you didn't receive the [ABC instruction](https://hackernoon.com/project-as-code-the-catalyst-devops-needs-atu732wt) that the developers sent you.

So it’s like those good old school days when you’re trying to dominate everyone else’s efforts, [in pursuit of your A+](https://hackernoon.com/my-journey-to-achieving-devops-bliss-without-useless-aws-certifications-a7cbf7c539d1).

On the contrary, the [DevOps approach](https://hackernoon.com/devops-shouldnt-be-hard-cd-server-yy152kkm) reminds you of the college times when everyone is chipping in united by a shared goal. [DevOps](https://hackernoon.com/devops-shouldnt-be-hard-reporting-s8k2k2r) not only generates crucial concepts and tools to create automated workflows but also boosts the [integration of team collaboration](https://hackernoon.com/devops-shouldnt-be-hard-github-actions-fq192hrl) tools to these workflows.

## The Bottom Line

Love it or hate it, the [DevOps](https://hackernoon.com/self-service-the-key-to-unlock-devops-51d50fd39e1d) approach has caused irrevocable changes in the tech world. And instead of [going against the stream](https://hackernoon.com/can-we-apply-devops-principles-to-project-management-k927j31mw), it’s better to embrace complementary DevOps practices, thus [improving](https://hackernoon.com/what-does-peeling-an-egg-have-to-do-with-devops-e55108a4e83c) operational productivity, quality, and revenues as well.
