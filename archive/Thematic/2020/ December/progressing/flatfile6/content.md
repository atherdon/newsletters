# The Future Is No Code

<p style="text-align: right">
<em>“The future of coding is <a href="https://hackernoon.com/no-no-code-will-not-kill-code-ever-period-0v1u3zw9">no coding at all</a>.”</em> - Chris Wanstrath, CEO at GitHub.</p>


[Wix](https://hackernoon.com/search?query=wix) makes you a site-builder, [Canva](https://hackernoon.com/search?query=canva) makes you a video maker. The [no-code approach](https://hackernoon.com/search?query=no+code) is what can make you a data analyst and a citizen developer – all in one.  

Today, when the tendency to automation and no code is gaining momentum, we are clearly rolling into the ‘[Code-Free](https://hackernoon.com/13-freelow-cost-sites-to-supercharge-your-programming-self-education-lq1l3umu)’ era. No matter your [level of expertise](http://35.244.241.141/everyone-will-soon-build-software-with-no-code-alexandre-omeyer-t14v3t6d) and acumen, you have to gain a thorough understanding of using the [no-code approach](http://35.244.241.141/inspiring-story-of-a-victorious-n8n-expert-that-will-give-you-motivation-jwk3t5f) to dealing with data fast [while having fun](http://35.244.241.141/how-to-apply-the-pareto-principle-to-learning-any-no-code-platform-m04b3ezq) along the way.

## A Short Primer on No code for Data

[No-code platforms](http://35.244.241.141/build-an-ecommerce-mobile-app-using-google-sheets-stripe-and-glide-cb1f3tua) provide a hassle-free way to help everyone [see and understand their data](https://hackernoon.com/how-no-code-can-rekindle-your-relationship-with-data-science-9o6e3ad4\). These [AI-powered platforms](https://hackernoon.com/challenges-in-successful-implementation-on-machine-learning-ai-in-smes-u336z3rf2) allow you to connect to almost any database, drag and drop to create visualizations, and share with a click. [Businesses](https://hackernoon.com/b2b-fintech-trends-for-2021-storage-security-cloud-migration-iaac-vw1m3wvm) can now [create datasets](https://hackernoon.com/10-best-image-classification-datasets-for-ml-projects-kt2l3zzf), train and [deploy models](https://hackernoon.com/ai-and-iot-transforming-the-future-of-website-design-8w4r3wcl) with no-coding knowledge [whatsoever](https://hackernoon.com/those-machines-in-the-cloud-c988f36b6bef). A graphical UI also presents the design environment to integrate [third-party apps](https://hackernoon.com/founder-interview-dr-vaisagh-viswanathan-of-impress-ai-396c69a572b2) so that they can be set up and [managed for data connectivity](https://hackernoon.com/understanding-artificial-intelligence-as-a-service-aiaas-780f2e3f663c).

As a result, you bridge a gap between business and data analytics in significantly less time while sticking to the budget.

Overall, no-code platforms support many different use cases from automation and [customer service](https://hackernoon.com/building-user-service-with-grpc-nodejs-and-mongodb-the-complete-microservice-tutorial-part-2-jkw34pt) to [data analysis](https://hackernoon.com/top-15-chatbot-datasets-for-nlp-projects-8k2f3zqc) or enterprise software development.

Beside guided platforms, [no-code data science](https://hackernoon.com/building-my-own-data-set-and-insights-here-is-what-i-learned-6ef7a93b0d59), or the ‘augmented’ [data science](https://hackernoon.com/top-20-image-datasets-for-machine-learning-and-computer-vision-rq3w3zxo), offers some other magic toolkits, including:



*   [Automated Machine Learning](https://hackernoon.com/automated-machine-learning-for-data-analysts-and-business-users-4lvr631qu) (AML): Allows to build and use ML models in the real world by performing processes on [raw data](https://hackernoon.com/rare-datasets-for-computer-vision-every-machine-learning-expert-must-work-with-2ddaf52ad862) and separates the wheat from the chaff (aka ‘the signal in the noise’)
*   Conversational Analytics: This NLP-driven analytics solution helps business owners [‘talk’ with data](https://hackernoon.com/creating-a-dataset-sucks-heres-what-ive-learned-to-make-it-a-little-bit-easier-5av3ed1), extract the [right data sets](https://hackernoon.com/top-10-regression-datasets-for-machine-learning-projects-ce4i3wuu), and make it available via voice or type queries.

This list describes the developmental milestones for the [no-code approach](https://hackernoon.com/ladies-and-getlemen-welcome-our-low-code-ml-platform-95i3t42). While guided platforms are the last [week's news](https://hackernoon.com/14-open-datasets-for-text-classification-in-machine-learning-xd1u3wit) and AML platforms have become deeply entrenched in the [data world](https://hackernoon.com/getting-started-with-natural-language-processing-us-airline-sentiment-analysis-4l7k327a), conversational analytics is just in its infancy.

### Why traditional integration approaches suck

Old-school manual-coding approaches to integration impede businesses from fast reacting to the [ever-evolving market](https://hackernoon.com/predictive-early-stopping-a-meta-learning-approach-za2d32yk). With conventional approaches, you spend (or waste) months of tech cycles to get hard lines of coding which equals [tech complexity](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-communicate-tech-debt-in-your-organization-f22a43633656). Tech teams fritter away [precious working hours](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-define-and-spend-your-tech-debt-budget-8429z32h2) on building and managing integration flows.

Besides, most teams accountable for building integration flows are not heavily engaged in business operations. As a result, the [end goal](https://hackernoon.com/you-dont-reach-your-business-goals-because-you-dont-have-any-ptdo32ag) does not meet the [business goals](https://hackernoon.com/3-steps-on-how-to-set-your-business-goals-for-2019-f25cfae8d661). On top of it, functional silos and data swamps hinder tech specialists from fetching data for modern-day [B2B operations](https://hackernoon.com/pool-architecture-for-saas-qil3ur3).

Although it's not panacea, the no-code approach may [be your magic pill](https://hackernoon.com/the-secret-mindset-of-the-successful-entrepreneurs-2rvx2wsp) that will cure [tech complexity](https://hackernoon.com/coding-like-a-pro-t81lg38j1). [Automated features](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-apply-machine-learning-and-deep-learning-methods-to-audio-analyis-wt6p32qz) for integration [help business owners](https://hackernoon.com/top-10-ways-business-owners-can-benefit-from-artificial-intelligence-ai-7z1r32ud) to integrate technologies and processes in an intricate and distributed tech environment.


## Zero Code Integration: How To Kick It Off

*   Choose your perfect integration technology: First and foremost, businesses should search for an all-inclusive enterprise [integration tool](https://hackernoon.com/a-list-of-artificial-intelligence-tools-you-can-use-today-for-personal-use-1-3-7f1b60b6c94f) that includes [no-code integration](https://hackernoon.com/no-code-is-eating-the-world-nrn3udw) features. With the perfect tool in their hands, business users will be able to automate workflows, establish [connections](https://hackernoon.com/fabio-manganiello-on-home-made-computer-vision-iot-automation-ai-4f7a3t79), and scale them for profiting from [b2b systems](https://hackernoon.com/7-b2b-storytelling-marketing-strategies-with-examples-sg2r3w9d).
*   Define the integration drivers: [Business users](https://hackernoon.com/5-examples-of-lead-generation-activities-for-b2b-and-saas-companies-yw3c32sw) should pinpoint governance, compliance, and security controls that will help create integration connections and data exchanges.
*   Invest in [training](https://hackernoon.com/what-is-a-data-breach-and-how-small-businesses-can-prevent-it-loa7z3zvs): Businesses heading for [zero code integration](https://hackernoon.com/6-no-code-tools-to-help-your-business-automation-and-product-launches-bg3l3wv9) should pick up the tab for training lessons. Thorough knowledge will ensure that their no-code approach will come to fruition.

## The Bottom Line

No matter how much your business is data-driven, if you store petabytes of data in the data oceans while accessing it via legacy solutions, you will never understand the speed of insights or the associated [business value](https://hackernoon.com/business-process-standardization-for-those-who-are-not-in-the-fortune-500-yet-9u18327k). On the contrary, zero-code solutions put businesses on a faster line, align [business processes](https://hackernoon.com/business-process-automation-is-key-to-the-success-of-the-future-workforce-0s4e3uni) with technology, and put an end to [shadow IT](https://hackernoon.com/7-mistakes-b2b-startups-make-when-expanding-abroad-4ab345f7e27e). No-code tools allow non-experts to develop at scale and free experts from mundane tasks at the same time.
