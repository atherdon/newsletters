## Introducing: [Experts.HackerNoon.com](https://experts.hackernoon.com/?ref=noonifications.tech)

Hello, would you like to book a call with technology experts? We started a marketplace for [on demand video calls with experts](https://experts.hackernoon.com/?ref=hackernoon.com) in programming, cryptocurrency, ux remote work, outer space, startups, and futurism.

The functions of the app are search, filter by expertise, sort by price, profile page, write a review, and a big call to action that clicks through to the [Superpeer](https://superpeer.com/?ref=hackernoon.com) booking and scheduling experience. **Writers set their own rate and availability for all video calls.** This program is a revenue share with 80% of the earnings going to the writer and 20% going to Hacker Noon, and an additional 3% transaction fee via Superpeer.

I built [Hacker Noon Experts](https://experts.hackernoon.com/?ref=hackernoon.com) with a no code tool, [Glide](https://glideapps.com/r/clEMkcNnlfkguQ3wRYqB?ref=hackernoon.com), using Google Sheets as the database. Was fun to learn this no code platform.

Then [Dane](https://hackernoon.com/u/Dane?ref=hackernoon.com) integrated "Book a Call With @Username" into the Hacker Noon content management system, surfacing the button on the story and profile page. We'll continue to iterate on the design and flow.

Here are the [first 60 tech experts in the marketplace](https://hackernoon.com/book-a-call-with-the-first-60-hacker-noon-experts-xwiw3132?ref=hackernoon.com). You can also just [read Hacker Noon](https://hackernoon.com/tagged/?ref=hackernoon.com), and when you find a story where you may want to talk with the writer, consider booking a call.
