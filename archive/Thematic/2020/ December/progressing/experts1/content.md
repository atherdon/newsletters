## Introducing: Experts.HackerNoon.com
```


Hello, would you like to book a call with technology experts? We started a marketplace for [on demand video calls with experts](https://experts.hackernoon.com/?ref=hackernoon.com) in programming, cryptocurrency, ux remote work, outer space, startups, and futurism.



<p id="gdcalert1" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image1.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert2">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>

The functions of the app are search, filter by expertise, sort by price, profile page, write a review, and a big call to action that clicks through to the [Superpeer](https://superpeer.com/?ref=hackernoon.com) booking and scheduling experience. **Writers set their own rate and availability for all video calls.** This program is a revenue share with 80% of the earnings going to the writer and 20% going to Hacker Noon, and an additional 3% transaction fee via Superpeer.

I built [Hacker Noon Experts](https://experts.hackernoon.com/?ref=hackernoon.com) with a no code tool, [Glide](https://glideapps.com/r/clEMkcNnlfkguQ3wRYqB?ref=hackernoon.com), using Google Sheets as the database. Was fun to learn this no code platform. 



<p id="gdcalert2" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image2.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert3">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>

Then [Dane](https://hackernoon.com/u/Dane?ref=hackernoon.com) integrated "Book a Call With @Username" into the Hacker Noon content management system, surfacing the button on the story and profile page. We'll continue to iterate on the design and flow.

![alt_text](images/image3.jpg "image_tooltip")


Here are the [first 60 tech experts in the marketplace](https://hackernoon.com/book-a-call-with-the-first-60-hacker-noon-experts-xwiw3132?ref=hackernoon.com). You can also just [read Hacker Noon](https://hackernoon.com/tagged/?ref=hackernoon.com), and when you find a story where you may want to talk with the writer, consider booking a call.

If interested in becoming a **Hacker Noon Expert** and receiving leads for paid video calls, [please fill out this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSce_si23Kc8Ydmv27J9Z4f_BdwY5VWczKDGtZBGtUPCsbDW0Q/viewform?ref=hackernoon.com). A human is reviewing each form submission and we'll be rolling out invites to expert technologists.

Hope you enjoy meeting the person on the other side of the story!
