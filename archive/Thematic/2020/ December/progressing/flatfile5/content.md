# Top 3 Security Practices that Protect Your Business Data

Being the [lifeblood of your business, data](https://hackernoon.com/the-importance-of-monitoring-big-data-analytics-pipelines-hd3i3uja) is inevitably weaved in all your operational processes. Whether we’re talking about a [huge corporation](https://hackernoon.com/3-industries-harnessing-the-power-of-big-data-healthcare-law-and-retail-fs14s3wwp) or a [promising start-up](https://hackernoon.com/visualization-of-hypothesis-on-meteorological-data-9j153wmy), [information security](https://hackernoon.com/5-big-data-trends-for-the-post-pandemic-future-zmx3ux6) can make or break your business.

We don't have to go far in search of the repercussions when a [business fails](https://hackernoon.com/search?query=business+fail) to safeguard [confidential information](https://hackernoon.com/legal-business-documents-non-disclosure-agreement-and-demand-letter-55333y39). In May 2019 Canva, an Australian tech unicorn and a graphic-design tool website made the headlines when confidential data of almost [140 mln users](https://www.zdnet.com/article/australian-tech-unicorn-canva-suffers-security-breach/) have been put up [for sale on the dark web](https://hackernoon.com/search?query=dark%20web).

If you are [still not impressed](https://hackernoon.com/tagged/data-breach), how about some stats? The average [cost of a data breach](https://www.capita.com/sites/g/files/nginej146/files/2020-08/Ponemon-Global-Cost-of-Data-Breach-Study-2020.pdf) in 2020 is around $150 per one [compromised record](https://hackernoon.com/facebook-forced-me-to-use-a-password-manager-16af91e2885d) that contains Personally Identifiable Information. It sounds like a sweet spot to [make cybercriminals prey](https://hackernoon.com/tagged/cybersecurity) on this precious commodity. As a result, [almost 25% of businesses](https://media.kaspersky.com/pdf/it-risks-survey-report-cost-of-security-breaches.pdf) fall victim to [data breaches](https://hackernoon.com/3-steps-retailers-should-take-to-prevent-holiday-data-breaches-ep1g3wsh) with an average fraud loss of almost $40,000.

So if your company’s New Year’s Resolution is to [amplify data security](https://hackernoon.com/how-an-improved-working-relationship-between-employer-and-employee-could-be-the-key-to-cybersecurity-uh4v3w42), read on for [proven practices](https://hackernoon.com/20-data-security-risks-your-company-could-face-in-2020-uakk32lh) to keep hackers at bay and give your [valuable information](https://hackernoon.com/with-telehealth-on-the-rise-privacy-regulations-are-imperative-h52p3w1r) the love and care it deserves.


## Getting ahead of cybersecurity breaches: Business edition

### **Stick to the essentials**

The more data you [pile up about your clients](https://hackernoon.com/providing-customer-support-for-125-million-fortnite-players-c6a7af5b32a4) and employees, the more effort it takes to [keep this data safe](https://hackernoon.com/internet-data-privacy-full-guide-keep-your-data-safe-online-6p7x3z17). Companies are usually big overdoers regarding the amount of [stored information](https://hackernoon.com/all-about-security-information-and-event-management-em7n3ymz). As a result, their clients are the ones who take a hard blow when data falls into the [wrong unauthorized hands](https://hackernoon.com/3-benefits-of-zero-trust-to-customer-information-security-7c1dd48of).  

To [mitigate possible risks](https://hackernoon.com/women-in-information-security-tha%C3%ADs-9c407bc60c3d), store only the essential or critical data required for your business needs. In case you require additional information for the time being, make sure to dispose of it properly when you no longer need it.

### **Create a data fortress**

Scammers and hackers are _always_ looking for new ideas. Sometimes, they treacherously use a savage [cyberattack](https://hackernoon.com/women-in-information-security-zo%D1%91-rose-997ccc289f60). Sometimes, they creep in through a back entrance to your [operating systems or security](https://hackernoon.com/how-we-can-make-the-modern-web-experience-more-secure-zheh38s2). Sometimes, they send welcoming ‘postcards’ with totally legit links. That is why you need perimeter fences to safeguard [your business data](https://hackernoon.com/6-measures-to-eliminate-business-risks-885be9cd56ea). To make your fences indestructible, you need to:



*   use [firewalls](https://hackernoon.com/the-great-firewall-of-china-is-not-so-great-afterall-0qt34mu); 
*   make sure your [antivirus](https://hackernoon.com/newest-malware-from-china-8a1k3uem) is up and running;
*   use a U2F Key or other [two-factor authentication](https://hackernoon.com/protecting-your-data-online-using-strong-passwords-and-two-factor-authentication-a-guide-av4o3web);
*   [encrypt](https://hackernoon.com/quantum-resistant-encryption-why-you-urgently-need-it-s41m3zte), encrypt and encrypt more;
*   disable webcams and microphones ([conspiracy theories](https://hackernoon.com/while-were-all-super-into-conspiracy-theories-lets-talk-ai-ethics-and-google-6n4p3ueg) have entered the chat).


### **Educate your employees on data security**

Unfortunately, [email security](https://hackernoon.com/the-essential-guide-to-email-security-threats-costs-and-strategies-3y5j3ujn) and [employee training](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-clean-up-the-mess-in-your-employee-training-program-581r2g8u) are usually among the top problems faced by companies even in our digital times. Not to mention, that [more than 30% of employees](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/resources/white-papers/user-risk-report) don’t have the slightest idea of [what phishing or malware is](https://hackernoon.com/7-deadly-digital-sins-understanding-the-main-types-of-malware-d71f3ypq). In reality, even cutting-edge technologies won’t save companies from [data breaches](https://hackernoon.com/dissecting-defensor-an-android-malware-that-affects-your-banking-apps-v5by30ad), as [employees are the most common entry points for phishers](https://hackernoon.com/anti-phishing-cybersecurity-product-market-an-analysis-q22k3zh0).

Therefore, cyber literacy is crucial for organizations with sensitive information. As the [Advanced Computing Systems Association (USENIX)](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/soups2020-reinheimer_0.pdf) suggests, the ideal training cadence occurs [every 4-6 months](https://hackernoon.com/phishing-top-threat-to-our-online-security-88t3uhg) with recurrent “live fire” training exercises and constant reminders.

By [investing in regular cybersecurity](https://hackernoon.com/whats-a-spear-phishing-attack-and-to-protect-yourself-from-it-2g2p3zm7) training and making it part of the onboarding process, companies make sure they don’t find themselves in the headlines.

## To Sum It Up

Even with emerging technologies and tightening [cyber regulations](https://hackernoon.com/8-sources-of-cyber-threat-and-domain-intelligence-for-enterprise-security-sz2j3xqi), cybersecurity still presents a weak spot even for the [most tech-savvy companies](https://hackernoon.com/an-invitation-to-hack-microsofts-azure-security-lab-n8bt3z9f). As threats are becoming increasingly sophisticated, neither small companies nor giant enterprises feel comfortable with [storing sensitive data](https://hackernoon.com/bypassing-enterprise-encryption-policy-with-metadata-nj5018ca).

Although there’s no silver bullet on [best cybersecurity tips](https://hackernoon.com/phishing-my-company-an-infosec-lesson-for-businesses-ca69ab4ea906), such [essential practices](https://hackernoon.com/a-breakdown-of-todays-phishing-epidemic-f72e323m) as storing only the necessities, [using firewalls](https://hackernoon.com/browser-isolation-is-the-future-of-cybersecurity-but-how-can-you-cost-effectively-isolate-your-26bf5247d81f), and the U2F key, as well as raising awareness can [save your companies from backfire](https://hackernoon.com/online-brand-protection-how-monitoring-and-user-education-can-help-with-phishing-c52i32wc).
