Who's on Hacker Noon?


##### Hacker Noon Readers

Hacker Noon is a reflection of the technology industry. We publish 20-30 stories a day from real tech professionals. 

Our stories primarily fall into three buckets (software development, crypto/blockchain and startup/general tech), but all great tech perspectives have a home on Hacker Noon. 

Our readers are smart, wealthy and nerdy. According to [Alexa](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/hackernoon.com), most of our readers make over $100,000/year and when compared to the internet average, they are much more likely to have gone to college and grad school. However, like most of the tech industry, our community skews heavily male.
