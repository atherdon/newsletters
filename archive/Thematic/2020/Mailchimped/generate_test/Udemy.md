 [Distance learning](https://hackernoon.com/tagged/education) is a common practice in 2020, primarily due to quarantine. With [technology](https://hackernoon.com/tagged/technology), you can [listen to your lectures](https://hackernoon.com/tagged/self-improvement) while running, driving, cooking, or at the gym.

is a great thing. You can't cheat due to time limits, dude.

[only if they pass it](https://hackernoon.com/65-key-takeaways-from-the-pragmatic-programmer-from-journeyman-to-master-1b4n32cy)
