Many people are [learning online](https://hackernoon.com/5-ways-edtech-startups-are-setting-classroom-innovation-trends-o05p3y4z), and I [understand that](https://hackernoon.com/tagged/future). Scroll to see reasons and memes(below).

# Flexibility

1 I can learn [at my own pace](https://hackernoon.com/tagged/self-improvement). And don't feel guilty if I can't arrive on time. Sometimes, when you're busy, it's good for business. So nobody will make a face, because you’re stuck in traffic and late. 

Plus, I always hate when [teachers start to separate kids in my classroom](https://hackernoon.com/digitizing-learning-and-updating-classrooms-cs7g3yc4). It’s like segregation by skills and abilities.

So let’s say, one child is a teacher’s pet because he always does homework on time. Another child is considered dumb, so the teacher doesn’t even bother to give him or her an advanced task. And the third student just needs to catch up on some material, but nobody would wait for him or her. I switch between school and places that I call home a lot, so it's a pretty common thing.

**2 Learn from** [top experts](https://hackernoon.com/episode-30-opening-the-css-box-and-practices-41858d77479f) (you can't just afford to purchase the same amount of quality from local teachers or you just can’t afford to be mentored offline)

3  **Online content is accessible**. But only if you have the internet. There are still many places that don’t have the luxury of using the Internet. But it definitely better than [it was before](https://hackernoon.com/the-online-tech-teaching-hustle-w-udemy-bdad05e49d02), like 15 years ago. Still, I will be happy to see how everything will change when another 2 billion people join us. They will make it a better place, for sure.

4 You can work and still be able to learn in your spare time. 

Offline [teachers are humans](https://hackernoon.com/the-online-tech-teaching-hustle-race-to-the-top-search-result-b8c7ef0d448b), so they love to eat, sleep, and rest as well. So, nobody in the same timezone will be happy to [teach you ](https://hackernoon.com/learn-java-with-these-mobile-apps-k9h35iu) English pronunciation at 1 am. 

But our geoid Earth includes different time zones, so you are reachable for people from another country.

5 Resources of efficiency

You don't need to attend the whole course to start. 4 years ago, I decided to learn node js.

But it was hard from the [beginning](https://hackernoon.com/fast-and-asynchronous-accelerate-your-requests-using-pythons-asyncio-xk5j3y6h). How did I hack it? Was I a very responsible and plodding person? Nope. [I downloaded 4 videos](https://hackernoon.com/learning-the-basics-of-mongodb-by-writing-a-user-registration-api-pg6k3ynu) from youtube with a 1-hour duration each. I just lay down, did nothing, watched and listened.

No, I didn't make any notes, plus my memory looks like a dish for separating ramen and water. And I was not able to do all those fancy things (coding magic) from the start. Because I didn’t have any practice back then.

But it was my first step. I broke the wall of a scare, and even having low energy, I made the first step. Later I started to do simple things with step-by-step tutorials. And only in 2 months, [I started to "understand" what my teachers were explaining to me](https://hackernoon.com/how-covid-19-may-forever-change-the-way-professors-teach-8keh328c). Because step-by-step tutorials can't teach you to think correctly in terms of your coding language, but they can help to get your hands dirty.
