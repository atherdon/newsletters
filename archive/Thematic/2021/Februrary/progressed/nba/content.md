The Washington Post’s [Ben Golliver](https://benjamingolliver.com/) joins Hacker Noon CEO [David Smooke](https://www.davidsmooke.net/) to discuss the process of writing his new book, [“Bubbleball: Inside the NBA’s Fight to Save a Season,”](https://www.amazon.com/Bubbleball-Inside-NBAs-Fight-Season/dp/1419755536?&linkCode=sl1&tag=artmapincdbah-20&linkId=d97955373324ba2efdf60c7550df4c5f&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) and the pandemic’s impact on the NBA’s revenue. With no/few fans in the stands and the decline in the number of games from the pandemic, the National Basketball Association is expected to loss about $4 billion dollars in 2021. In addition to discussing his bubble writing and publishing process, we talk about the NBA’s options to stimulate revenue, such as [expansion fees for new franchises](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/01/08/nba-expansion-seattle-las-vegas/) and how to make substantial investments into the NBA’s digital experience.
