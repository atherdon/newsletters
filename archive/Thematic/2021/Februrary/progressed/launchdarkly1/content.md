Two decades after the dawn of the chiliad, software has taken over all spheres of our lives. There is literally [an app for everything](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-get-better-at-solving-programming-problems-cq2b3339) from mimicking an electric shaver to applications that help you avoid dating your cousin.

Reinforcing this constant flux of software is the DevOps pipeline of the innovative DevOps software development. It’s the power that mixes up a wunschpunsch from automation and cross-team collaboration to get a smooth shortcut to constant releases.

But these words ring hollow to you if you are green as grass to DevOps and just embarking on this journey. Take it easy, we are here to help you create your first [DevOps](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-get-better-at-solving-programming-problems-cq2b3339) pipeline and share a step-by-step process. While this tiny guide is non-exhaustive, it should point you in the right direction and set up your DevOps pipeline for success.


## **Nailing DevOps Pipelines Like A Pro**


### **Step 1. CI/CD framework**

First and foremost, you need a CI/CD tool to prevent integration hell. The most popular choice is Jenkins (unimpressed), which is [an open-source automation tool](https://hackernoon.com/2020s-top-10-development-frameworks-vp1j3zuw) written in Java, with plugins designed for continuous integration. Why the hype? Jenkins has advocated the DevOps approach and become a touchstone among CI/CD tools.


### **Step 2. Source control management**

Source control has been there longer than sand. It evolved from copying-and-pasting to SCM systems that provide a running history of code development like the ones we use today. These systems record and save multiple changes to files so you can go back to a specific point in the history of a file or project change.

Whether you're DIYing a standard app or contributing to a huge software project, source code management is a critical detail of the development process. The Holy Grail of [all source control management](https://hackernoon.com/verification-and-configuration-management-for-avionics-systems-y31j3zw6) is Git, but there are some other options like Vesta you can go with.

_Sounds impressive. But can we go on to an operating solution that people can use and enjoy?_

_Sure, but you need a build automation tool._

### **Step 3. Automation tools**

Nice job! Now you can keep tabs on your code, commit changes to the source control or join forces with your friends. But you still don’t have an up-and-running application.

For that purpose, you need to compile and put the code into the deployable package for execution. And a built [automation](https://hackernoon.com/automation-for-girl-scout-events-35v31nm) tool is your best friend that compiles your source code into machine code by a build script. Thus, you can turn your lines of code into a viable web application.


### **Step 4. Web application server**

By this point, you only have an executable or deployable packaged file (hopefully), but you also need some kind of receptacle to host your application. [Application servers](https://hackernoon.com/apache-web-server-hardening-how-to-protect-your-server-from-attacks-tc1t3umm) provide facilities to create web applications and a server environment to run them. Within the DevOps framework, you’ll need an HTTP web server and an ideal environment like a virtual machine to install the server.

### **Step 5. Code testing**

Code testing is another essential step that allows developers to rectify bugs before they reach production and course-correct in the coding phase of development. In the case of DevOps, [the testing operations](https://hackernoon.com/dependency-injection-to-make-your-code-testable-a-how-to-guide-kj883211) are managed continuously, and if needed even after the applications enter the production stage.

You can make your life easier by using one of the open-source tools, which can further be plugged into the CI/CD tools to automate testing.


## **The Final Word**

There you have it, a cheat sheet for building your first DevOps pipeline. However, make sure that your pipeline supports and elevates team practices and [workflows](https://hackernoon.com/7-best-workflow-automation-software-available-online-8zp31fs). Your tooling and configurations should not slow down workflows or call for a complete process change.
