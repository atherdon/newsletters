# IoT: Beyond Light Bulbs and Alexa

Welcome to the [Internet of Things](https://hackernoon.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-internet-of-things-ce815339c9f9) world. Another [industrial revolution](https://hackernoon.com/the-growth-of-internet-of-things-effective-technology-opportunities-677f322m) that will surely overshadow all wonders of ages in the coming years. The whole world will get to hear about IoT devices [transforming](https://hackernoon.com/iot-as-a-multi-faceted-game-changer-in-2021-and-beyond-aot3woo) the way we live, drive, and farm animals and crops. However, unlike previous pivotal inventions, like the steam engines, industries won’t have to overhaul time-proven manufacturing systems and products. On the contrary, The [Internet Of Things](https://hackernoon.com/benefits-of-using-iot-and-ai-together-o9263tz0) can be [seamlessly integrated](https://hackernoon.com/how-iot-data-can-help-accelerate-digital-transformation-1y3i3u1s) into already existing processes, thus giving a new cover of data-driven paint.

But despite the existing number of connected devices, we are just [unfolding this new chapter](https://hackernoon.com/5-effective-ways-to-handle-iot-security-challenges-11y3461). Feeling our way through and pushing the ball forward by inventing lighting control systems with nice lighting effects. But [IoT limitless capabilities](https://hackernoon.com/the-way-to-building-integrated-data-platforms-with-iot-edge-devices-and-ai-algorithms-at-the-edge-q45a33xf) can create a more seismic shift in the landscape than we can ever imagine.

And there goes another but. [Developing software](https://hackernoon.com/industrial-iot-and-devops-how-to-get-started-lf25345w) for the cloud, like we do with the Internet of Things now, comes with [inherent risks and challenges](https://hackernoon.com/the-emergence-of-iot-security-in-the-post-covid-19-world-sb1f3zmg). Thus, the major pain point of this technology is its **[security vulnerabilities](https://hackernoon.com/smart-cities-cybersecurity-in-the-era-of-iot-6p103zsi)**. From i[nsecure network services to lack of device management](https://hackernoon.com/why-iot-security-is-only-as-good-as-the-weakest-link-ul3d3ut8), there is [quite a large number of entry points](https://hackernoon.com/iot-security-challenges-and-risk-mitigation-strategies-2fhf311m) that can result in, say, stopping the cooling system at a nuclear power plant.

Another [choke point](https://hackernoon.com/iot-product-management-4-critical-success-factors-zds3uk6) is the **determinism of the network**, which accounts for a delay of about 200 milliseconds or more. And whereas your fridge will be fine with that, other mission-critical [applications](https://hackernoon.com/future-of-microservices-iot-2efc0ca84eb6) require a rapid, almost immediate, response.

Among other things, we have to [invent something better](https://hackernoon.com/how-the-iot-landscape-is-changing-with-voice-enabled-technology-sm1j3udb) than smartphones with pathetic battery life. It would help to make a leap if power could be distributed wirelessly to [IoT-powered devices](https://hackernoon.com/mobile-apps-as-iot-core-exploring-the-connection-9fcdc2eefcbe) from a distance, or if [power sources](https://hackernoon.com/lessons-learned-from-evaluating-iota-on-internet-of-things-devices-a44575e606de) could last at least a year. In any case, the IoT is here to stay.

Most of the issues mentioned above will be fixed in a couple of years, although we do miss [one puzzle piece](https://hackernoon.com/eco-big-data-applications-in-the-big-city-cleaning-the-metropolis-with-iot-and-ml-si4o3uh8), which is a comprehensive framework and viable business model on how to implement and monetize IoT.
