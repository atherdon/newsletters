Been looking for the opportunity to sharpen your coding and writing skills? There it is, right with $1000 plus bragging rights on the world’s greatest tech publication!

[Hacker Noon]() has joined forces with [Wix]() to host the [Velo Writing Contest](), with $4,250 in prize money to be awarded to 10 lucky winners selected each month throughout the competition. If you’re a web developer OR a website-builder, you can win $1000 on Hacker Noon, every month.

Sponsored by Wix, the world-class website building platform, Hacker Noon is holding a writing competition to reward 10 best submissions a total of $4,250. Attendees will use Velo, Wix’s innovative development platform, to create web pages and applications and write about their fantastic work on Hacker Noon.

Velo was built to power robust web applications with zero setup, and we, at Hacker Noon, are absolutely sure that our noonies can showcase the full might of Velo.

## How to Enter the Velo Writing Contest

Entering the contest is as simple as 1-2-3…4

1. Build something amazing using Velo

2. Write an article about your work

3. Submit the article on Hacker Noon with the following tags: #velo and #build-velo-web-app

4. Once your article is published, share it on Twitter with #velo in the caption

## Contest Rules and Guidelines

While you can find out more about action lines here, we’ll touch upon the main points.

First of all, the only restriction is that you must be of age to enter the competition. Your expertise and hands-on experience can go from a coding guru to a complete amateur enthusiast. Also, you can be based in any part of the world - it really doesn’t matter.

As for your entry creation, you’re not limited in your artistic freedom as long as you follow Hacker Noon’s general submission guidelines. Basically, keep it SFW: building a Tinder clone is A-OK, but don’t use Velo to break into the adult film industry.

The contest will run for a total of 3 months: March 1st to May 31st, 2021, with prizes awarded at the end of each month.

NB! The first round will run until March 31st and we will start accepting submissions on February 20th.

As much as we want to credit every talented developer out there, we will select only 10 winners at the end of each month and distribute a monthly prize pool of $4250. The good news is that contestants can submit as many Velo stories as they want each month. However, you can only win 1 prize per month.

So these are all key points to mention there but make sure you’ll study contest rules and guidelines in more detail. 

Well, best of luck to you all!
