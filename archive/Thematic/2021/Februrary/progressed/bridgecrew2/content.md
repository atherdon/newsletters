# Top Ten DevOps Myths Debunked [Part II]

This is the second part of our series related to popular DevOps misconceptions and falsehoods. In the first part of our series we busted 5 myths surrounding [DevOps certification](https://hackernoon.com/devsecops-and-devops-a-deep-dive-j62k34r3), continuous integration, and continuous delivery as well as defined the role of automated tools in the practical implementation of this methodology. We also briefed you on the DevOps application fields and a symbiotic relationship between the approach in question and the cloud.

As the [terms and philosophy](https://hackernoon.com/how-can-developers-save-a-failing-project-learn-from-my-mistakes-l12a33f9) behind DevOps are continuously gaining traction, a growing number of DevOps misconceptions are floating around in both the tech and not-so-tech world. Although [lots of software companies](https://hackernoon.com/front-end-development-without-node_modules-using-skypack-and-snowpack-s03n33mk) have managed to sprinkle some DevOps on their regular workflows, the prevailing majority of them have reached the deadlock operating under some ubiquitous myths.

With that being said, let's disprove another 5 common DevOps myths that you might have  heard before.

## **Busting 5 More Myths about DevOps**



1. **DevOps Doesn’t Work for Enterprises**

    DevOps is applicable to everyone regardless of their industry or the company size. The implementation of this approach is fundamentally a change of process and the trick is that large companies don't set up cozy teams that can develop, qualify, and deploy code independently. Therefore, unlike [small and medium-sized organizations](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-cultivate-a-collaborative-devops-culture-ds1x334q), enterprises have to conduct an orchestra of hundreds of employees by applying a more methodical approach for how they create, qualify, and release the code.

2. **DevOps is a Cure-It-All Approach**

    Here’s the harsh truth: Neither [Agile](https://hackernoon.com/safe-a-scaled-agile-framework-in-a-nutshell-b4103170) (Waterfall, Scrum - choose your option) nor DevOps is a panacea. DevOps as an ethos has the ability to uplift the current ailing software practices and is touted as [the key to quality software](https://hackernoon.com/an-introduction-to-agile-practices-why-small-release-in-scrum-fk2m34h9). While this is certainly true, this philosophy can also pose potential risks and minor inconveniences like software feature bloating or narrow team member roles. So don’t expect it to take you from zero to a hero like a Fairy Godmother. Not to mention that it’s not an instant, off-the-shelf solution.

3. **DevOps Uses Only Open-Source Software**

    We all got wind of DevOps success stories when a company nailed it using the LAMP stack. However, while [DevOps](https://hackernoon.com/agile-is-the-best-13w3usb) calls for specific technological improvements like automated testing and version control configurations, it works just fine on apps running mainframes and firmware. DevOps is a set of principles, meaning that the approach is largely unaffected by the underlying technology being used. 

4. **DevOps Requires Teams’ Physical Proximity**

    If you still have this delusion after months of lockdown, you need [a good dose of reality](https://hackernoon.com/github-actions-and-go-areyouok-my-url-ao1d33a1). With the right tools and frameworks to promote communication and collaboration along the DevOps lifecycle, [remote workplace culture](https://hackernoon.com/a-solution-to-your-mental-health-worries-think-big-towards-your-future-and-the-rest-will-follow-flbk33gp) can go toe-to-toe with in-office teams. Besides, remote teams usually have greater visibility into what others are working on, which also supports the main idea of DevOps.

5. **DevOps Guns for ITIL**

    Although some may view DevOps as a backlash to ITIL, in reality, they complement each other. ITIL remains the best codification of the processes that buttress IT [Operations](https://hackernoon.com/how-security-operations-is-a-journey-not-a-destination-an-analysts-perspective-d45s31iu) and sums up lots of capacities required to prompt a DevOps-style workstream. So instead of choosing between ITIL and DevOps, pick and utilize the best from both worlds. 



## **The Many Faces Of DevOps**

With this, we’ve covered some of the most common myths regarding DevOps. While no DevOps playbook can guide you through the adoption process, you can at least develop a holistic understanding of this methodology to avoid bumps. You just need a bit of a perfect combination of [workflow, tools, and potential individuals](https://hackernoon.com/saas-pricing-best-practices-overcoming-challenges-and-paralysis-as7k33qo) to deliver the desired outcomes.
