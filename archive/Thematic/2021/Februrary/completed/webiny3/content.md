XXXXXXXXXXXX





[Serverless adoption](https://hackernoon.com/serverless-the-future-of-development-xfs36d1) has been taking off throughout recent years with more and more people relying on [serverless technologies](https://hackernoon.com/what-is-aws-lambda-or-serverless-f0a006e9d56c) to meet the unique needs of organizations. In 2018, a survey conducted by Serverless, Inc demonstrated that half of the respondents have been using serverless in their work.

With the advent of a new decade, this technology has experienced an influx of new followers with its market projected to reach almost $22M by 2025. With a growth velocity of this magnitude, businesses will likely see more trailblazing use cases.

For now, however, let us describe some core use cases for this technology as of 2021. Hopefully these can serve as your inspiration to [start your very own serverless journey](https://hackernoon.com/getting-started-with-cloud-computing-an-overview-il2k34oa).


### **4 Use Cases for Serverless (+ Bonus)**



1. **Converting Images to Thumbnails**... _just kidding_. 

Although it’s still a great use case, [serverless](https://hackernoon.com/wtf-is-commercial-open-source-software-ep143e5t) has come a much longer way.



2. **Ops Automation - NoOps**

Serverless computing has taken DevOps to the next level by moving modular services to the cloud. It allows [NoOps](https://hackernoon.com/move-over-devops-hello-jeff-noops-d194f01df002) teams to eliminate some of the tasks connected with pipeline management and do justice to development and deployment processes. The serverless technology also enables teams to jump into the testing right away on a comfortable scale. As a result, DevOps can eliminate time and cost spent on the back end.



3. **Remote Health Services - Not By Tech Alone**

mHealth is all the rage at the moment. In pre-serverless times, healthcare organizations had to spend around 30% of their time to ensure server responsiveness, with companies having to juggle multiple technology services to handle spikes caused by an increase in [server traffic](https://hackernoon.com/how-local-development-is-dying-and-why-its-for-the-better-mp2q3wlx). Serverless ushered in easy scaling so that organizations can build healthcare services for an unlimited amount of demand whether it’s a lab service or any other [telehealth solution](https://hackernoon.com/telemedicine-benefits-challenges-and-managing-expectations-i91o3y1o).

4. **Serverless and Chatbots - A Match Made in Heaven**

Unless you are living under the rock, you must have heard or even talked to [chatbots](https://hackernoon.com/building-chat-of-the-future-what-you-need-and-what-you-really-need-7a470cd02e75); wonderful conversational agents that were meant for serverless architecture as well. The latter allows users to implement sophisticated chatbots that [automatically](https://hackernoon.com/chatbots-in-2021-what-you-need-to-know-7f123482) deploy, configure, and catch up with managed [AWS services](https://hackernoon.com/aws-reinvent-the-five-most-important-serverless-announcements-ce1v31f1). In case a chatbot goes viral, the serverless framework will back up the solution so that it isn’t rendered unresponsive.



5. **Real-Time Data Processing Apps - Instant Insights**

Big Data deployment in the Cloud is linked up with lots of stumbling blocks like under and over usage of computing resources. [Serverless architecture](https://hackernoon.com/introduction-to-idaas-and-its-applications-evv31uc) has pulled Data out of the fire and mitigated those problems. Giants such as Netflix, Mapbox, and New York Times are using the serverless potential to obtain a data processing platform that can process any amount of data with consistent throughput.

6. **Web Applications - Last But Not Least**

Serverless web [applications](https://hackernoon.com/an-introduction-to-elasticsearch-lightning-fast-search-solutions-jm2o34si) are among the most popular serverless use cases and have always been there since the [AWS Lambda](https://hackernoon.com/aws-lambda-top-14-use-cases-for-your-business-or1u34t3) launch. Today, serverless architecture powers smooth execution of back-end application code and allows the creation of scalable and efficient web apps for the end-user. It is also a safe bet for [web applications](http://bit.ly/39FeteF) since serverless will take off the burden of provisioning and help you focus on the code.

_In this same way, you can rely on **[Webiny](https://bit.ly/3ofsO6M)** to provide what you need. Webiny is a **[CMS for the serverless era](https://bit.ly/3ofsO6M)**. You can run Webiny in your own cloud on top of the serverless infrastructure and **[your data stays with you](https://bit.ly/3ofsO6M)**.

### **The Sky's the Limit**

Overall, [serverless](https://hackernoon.com/how-your-startup-can-benefit-from-serverless-approach-skq311g) is as useful as an all-purpose glue that can connect almost everything without bloated integration platforms. If you’ve been on the fence about it, we hope this newsletter assuaged those doubts and made you warm up to the mighty Serverless. For those already on the bandwagon: Trust the cloud instead of reinventing the wheel.
