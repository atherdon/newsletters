2020 was a worldwide shitshow. The pandemic displaced team members, placed stress on families, and redefined what and where the day to day even is.

**Work goes on.**

As a company, we managed to double revenue for the third year in a row and raise some strategic funding. I'm still learning how to make a quality internet company. We wouldn't be where we're at without the technological progress and innovation from so many other people, projects, and organizations.

**This year at[ Hacker Noon](https://hackernoon.com), we decided to make our yearly donation $10k, choosing 7 established nonprofits that consistently give more value back to the internet, and 3 less established open source contributors that have a ton of potential.**

I'm publishing this list because:



*   whether it's[ $1k](https://hackernoon.com/hacker-noon-donates-to-eff-in-support-of-a-better-internet-xbep3626), $10k or $[10M](https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ALeKk03Qg-A4GIG1_astE-B6ExpKXupC3g%3A1608906656391&ei=oPflX6ueF8OztQaOpr_QBg&q=10+million+dollar+donation&oq=10+million+dollar+donation&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzICCAAyBAgAEB4yBggAEAUQHjIGCAAQBRAeMgYIABAFEB4yBggAEAUQHjoECAAQRzoGCAAQBxAeOgQIABBDOgcIABAUEIcCOgcIIxCwAhAnOggIABAIEAcQHjoICAAQBxAFEB46BAgAEA06BggAEA0QHjoICAAQDRAFEB5QnxRY7ytg7ixoAHADeACAAV-IAbIJkgECMTaYAQCgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6yAEIwAEB&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwir7uutrOntAhXDWc0KHQ7TD2oQ4dUDCA0&uact=5), I'd like to encourage other internet companies to make a yearly donation based on a small fraction of yearly revenue.
*   offer an interview on the Hacker Noon podcast for any individual or organization who wants to match some of these donations over the next year
*   and to ask, if you want to recommend a nonprofit or open-source project for 2021 or 2022's internet donation,[ contact us](https://hackernoon.com/contact).

These nonprofit organizations and open source projects work towards economically sustainable ways to make a better internet. In one way or another, these donations follow the community-driven Hacker Noon editorial line, where writers and editors have collaborated to publish 75,000+ stories around topics like[ software development](https://hackernoon.com/tagged/software-development),[ startups](https://hackernoon.com/tagged/startup),[ A.I.](https://hackernoon.com/tagged/ai),[ cryptocurrency](https://hackernoon.com/tagged/cryptocurrency),[ bitcoin](https://hackernoon.com/tagged/bitcoin),[ web development](https://hackernoon.com/tagged/web-development),[ business](https://hackernoon.com/tagged/business),[ marketing](https://hackernoon.com/tagged/marketing),[ machine learning](https://hackernoon.com/tagged/machine-learning),[ productivity](https://hackernoon.com/tagged/productivity), and[ more](https://hackernoon.com/tagged/).

I saw Jimmy Wales give a talk once where he explained his first approach to a digital encyclopedia was to commission experts. That failure led to arguably the greatest crowdsourced knowledge the world has ever seen. Learn, learn, learn. What a knowledge source.

Learning to code can transform someone's economic potential. It's as close to digital literacy as one can get. FreeCodeCamp is very efficient when it comes to reducing the cost it takes to learn to code.
