# **Writing Hack: Target the 22 Most Trafficked Tag Pages on Hacker Noon**

Tags are the internet's indexing system. When you submit a story to Hacker Noon, you get not three, not five, but EIGHT tags. Tags work for you, as a writer, in two important ways:

1. **Tags help [Google](https://hackernoon.com/tagged/google), [Bing](https://hackernoon.com/tagged/bing), [DuckDuckGo](https://hackernoon.com/tagged/duckduckgo) and friends find your content,** in order to serve it to users searching for those terms.
2. **Tags help Hacker Noon distribute your content to top trafficked pages,** as well as the most subscribed tags via our customizable newsletter, The Tech Brief.
