# Cautious Optimism Visible In Companies As Countries Begin Flattening The Curve

As a child, you never knew when the ice cream truck would arrive. They didn’t have schedules. But, a few tolls of that familiar bell ringing, and you’d know that the truck had entered your neighborhood.

Everything that is immeasurable on a scale, is measured using either **estimates** (stock market prices), **ranges** (weather), or flat-out **signs** (arrival of seasons).

When would this pandemic end? We don’t know.

What we do know is that tech companies have decided to back in business, especially with respect to productivity and deliveries, by October-November.

**How Do We Know That?**

Well, we looked at **signs** (our sponsorship meeting requests skyrocketed. We looked at **ranges** (a whopping 90% of all sponsorship requests were looking for a late-October to early-November AD buys).

When those dates got sold out, a curious phenomenon was noticed.

Not only did the race to buy out all AD slots for the succeeding dates (Mid-November onwards) intensify but the preceding dates (late-October backwards) also were filled up at record pace.

**The Result: [Hacker Noon Billboard AD slots](https://sponsor.hackernoon.com/billboard) are now 100% filled out for the rest of the year.**

**Does that mean that you cannot buy AD Slots on Hacker Noon for the rest of the year?**

Not really.

We created a tonne of more advertising options for tech companies to help them ensure advertisement up time during peak season.
